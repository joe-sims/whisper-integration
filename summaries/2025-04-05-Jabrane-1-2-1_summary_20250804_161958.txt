FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 Can put those 5 views in the audienceandra chapter requires intervention and some info. Yes of course We're not tired of it yet. Yeah, I'm just gonna get my coffee that I started before this No, yeah, yeah same thing as usual like on Saturday Saturday I went I went like we went surfing in the morning super early Like we woke up at like seven a.m Because the conditions were good in the morning like at 8.30 and you need to drive and stuff So yeah, it was good was a very busy weekend to bonus because we went surfing and then Came back it was obviously our first year anniversary for like waiting like a first year anniversary We celebrated that on the on Saturday evening And Sunday yesterday we had the there are some friends who came like Inderage to spend some two weeks of holidays so we went like to see them And you know spend some time with them they have two kids so it's nice also to like spend some time with the kids and stuff Yeah This morning I've been looking for how to buy Pokemon cards because I just understood that My friend son is really into a pocketman cut and they have no idea how to get that Because apparently it's like now something that's super important The L. This is like an oldest is the Seven years old and the other one is one one years old so like baby, okay There is a big gap I've got some experience of Pokemon so I can help you It's very popular at the moment even with adults like it's a Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah huge boom Yeah, like the simplest ways to buy little booster booster packs which they open and Like I guess that's the best way it can be quite disappointing because if they don't get like a shiny card Then it's So almost like yeah, you get that little higher yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so my song went through that whole and how many other anyone booster? I think it's 10 10 cards Okay, but okay, and they do also like pay attention to buy like read ones and not like fake ones Booster packs because apparently there is there is a lot of you know like fake Like it depends what you buy it from like if it most like I don't know what's like in France, but Corner shops around here they might have like boost but booster packs behind the cashier Otherwise you'd have to get some kind of a no general store Like that might sell them So like the game stores no they have these paintings and then it can only be really not gonna be fake if it's like an official like stall I think a store would be there's a lot more rest for a store like if they were selling fake Based the fact then even they got scammed or that the scammers and if they got caught then that's probably Here series three questions. So I think they're more likely to be real in a store Because in Borgot I found two options either there are a lot of specialized, you know stores Yeah, like cards and people also sit there and because in France it's super popular like board games and so yeah So I have that and this also good because you support you know the local economy Then I found you know like these big chains That that are you know like in these malls and you know they're usually sell on like toys and stuff like that And yeah, I also saw that so I don't know like if I go for the first one or the second one Okay, so Cool that you got a specialist card shop. They're probably gonna have just some booster packs which you can buy if you really want to go Like above and beyond you could try and ask what their favorite Pokemon is so which character they like the most In that specialist card shop they might sell singles like rare cards So like a booster pack might cost like six pounds But like a really good card good cost six pounds And you obviously in a booster pack you might just get rubbish cards So it might be better if you know what their like favorite Pokemon card is you could say like you could give them that Okay, I'm gonna ask yeah That that would be or you could just buy some booster packs and I'm sure there would be happy about sure I was thinking to buy like two the booster The one back and then like one Yeah, I think once I give him like the booster pack he starts looking and if he's disappointed I'm like yes I cover all bases Exactly all the scenarios Thank you so what do we in this we're gonna do the main trick on this Coming up the message So yeah, no it was very nice with them like It was five hours in the end like that because they have like you know that in this campaign would like this Yeah, what we can rent you know like your own kind of mobile home kind of So it's very nice yeah Yeah, so it was nice to spend some time there how about you weekend? I was in did you buy any Pokemon cards? No, my son is over that craze He went through like he was quite obsessed with that for a while Yeah, yeah, like it is it is a bit like gambling because he keeps wanting to Get the booster packs to find the good cards and it's like the odds of guessing a good card is incredibly low so Yeah, we so I ended up buying singles for him and we like tried to complete a set and then eventually it's just kind of His interest is what did you move to? No, just little toys like Yeah, yeah Although recently the start of some of the other sort of some holidays you can buy like What's called Pokemon Battle Academy and it's comes with some decks and you can actually play So I bought that for him and we have been playing the actual card game Because yeah, I'm more interested that he gets it like and gets into that because I've been know there's some log jig problem solving it's a big competitive So yeah, we've been playing that a few games during some of like the past week or so Isn't it like two to young for to play the proper because that's what I and and there's so like online is that It's hard to play like you need to be a bit older than that no I can play like you probably wouldn't beat me Like But he can read like when you do damage you have to say 10 minus a hundred is ninety He can do that kind of math so yeah, he can play So the deck is like what like kind of bored that you bought so that you can put the cards all right Yeah, because like the cards have like you've got The active Pokemon which is in the middle of the board then you've got the bench Pokemon so the board like Tells you exactly where to pull the cards and there's like instructions written on to the board saying like during your turn You can Draw a card play a card so It makes it a lot simpler for them to understand Like it's okay cool But yeah, they're like I've Kind of been introducing board games to him since a very young age so like I'm slowly training him up to Be a board game master so Do like play them yourself? I used to like before children a lot more Like I grew up like Pokemon became popular when I was like 10 years old so I played Pokemon a lot when I was young And then yeah, but like as an adult they mean yeah, no they're like those I'm trying to remember the year it I feel like around 2014 2015 around that time There was like a ball game boom in the UK like I think there was some popular American YouTube channels that were like Like showing how to play them so me and my co-workers used to play during lunch times Back when everyone was in the office and Yeah, I really got into some good board games and like I've those board games are played now then I bought for my son, but like the kid version like As one could cockassong Which obviously is a french town That costume yeah, I know that but they don't know the game so little it's like little tile game and you have to like Build out a map and then you score points, but it's very good. Okay very good adult game and a good kids game as well See yeah, I've played a few board games and I'm gonna try and encourage my son to play them Nice vertical My weekend yeah, no Pokemon but I had some friends from Vienna Stay over they've got two school boys a similar age boys to ours So there's five children in the house at the moment, which yeah, it's pretty crazy Yeah, I don't get this thing for just they stayed last night like a stay tonight as well and then leave tomorrow Oh, yeah, it's a lot the house was a bump site as well before they arrived so we spent stuff today cleaning up and then they arrived yesterday Yeah, and now you need to clean again. Yeah, wouldn't that leave? Well, he's a clean again and yeah, yes It's tiring but I guess the kids have fun the kids the kids are having a great time Wishings the main point yeah, nice very cool. Thank you Nice that's your friendship You yeah, you sent him message earlier saying the about the career ladder Yeah, yeah, it's not gonna change much like it hasn't changed much since Since it used to exist like it might be good reviewing it and seeing oh like if there's anything that we could take from that and add to the girls But like I don't think so like it would only be supplementary if we did that I think I don't think it's gonna drastically change the girls the way to release that Okay, yeah, because it's true that I read that I read the What Robyshire last time and it's not too different from what we we discussed earlier yeah like before in our mission so I think maybe already had this question with him when he was preparing this yes, that's right So that's why we have a Think that it actually coincide yes Just coming from the same source exactly. I'm the one who helped create it. So I should be aware of what's in there And there'll be a bit strange if it was a bit different what we discussed so yeah Yeah, I'll let you have to personalize but I don't think that's that's a possibility I'm again slightly crazy that I'll be able to get so But now yeah, what else yeah, how's it week looking? I think quite calm again I have a couple of meetings with Ella But we're expecting some like RFPs from many prospects One of them should come I think Thursday this week The other one is would be in two weeks So that's what we'll I think keep us a bit busy Yeah Yeah, let's see two moments said the moment yeah, I was just checking your opportunities I guess the only one that's closing in all guests is Dr. Leb of a new but prim is a small upsell Is it still as you see me? I guess so yeah Because I hope I helped Dr. Leb some time ago, but I think this one is just a normal renewables so You know we're not necessarily very involved in these Yeah, but I think it's coming from Stefan It's a Stefan's opia. I know this one. Okay, I helped all of it in the beginning, but then I think it was given to prim after Stefan left yeah Yeah, otherwise all the other opportunities due to closed instead of timber like captain on time yeah Yeah, yeah this this week is a it's a bit like come for the moment let's see how how it How it changes you know like As we go forward Yeah one thing the before Laura went on Laura Maddo's went on holiday She put me in contact with the Signhost sales team they are looking to learn more about the product like for mainly from an adhesive perspective the kind of detail we would get So I was put in touch with some of the sales leaders over there and tried to understand what they wanted So I'm trying to find chat They're talking about Product demonstrations so they can at least answer basic questions from potential customers prospect better qualified it out better Yeah, so quite high level, but I think there's one bit more in depth Would you be interested in running such a session for that team or teams they should say Yeah, of course Given the you've obviously closed the intensity of like that would be a good use case to show like here's a full full end to end on video sign post solution So it would probably bring it to life a little bit better and you could I guess you have that experience of knowing custom the questions kind of cut customer pushback and Yeah, we would say you need a much like it's not like he's a full blown presentation it would just literally be Kind of high level product overview Discussing on feed O sign host and kind of our general approach possesses potentially like during Let's say Product overview session Yeah, so they want to to be able what's the final goal for them? They want to be able to position on feed all like properly in case they are talking with Customers like with the prospects about signing solutions or existing customers They want to say okay, so we have IDV solution But I think that they want to know how to present it well present The solution but also be able to answer the questions, right? Is this the final much go for them? Yeah, I asked I tell asked them clarify that and Like they should still be an on feed O wrap involved in your opportunity so it's not like Yeah, but I think yeah, they want to be a little bit more independent to be able to position it They said they mentioned themselves that they've gone they've had the command of the message training so Like they should have a lot of information but perhaps it's just not that exposure to studio to the product Which they don't have so yeah, being able to answer some basic questions and just talk a bit more comfortably Probably about the product is what they're interested in Okay, I Will loop you into the group because I don't have any dates or Confirmation yet so I'll add into the conversation that some going but yeah I'll be great help. Thank you Yeah, of course. Yeah, just loop me and we'll see who decides on the The date and so on is there somebody on in this Since Laura is out I'm gay now there's three sales team leaders from Sign host so I imagine or maybe four actually See yeah, I when I leave you into the conversation I'll ask about dates Because maybe they have an enablement team meeting which we could join or Or we may just have to accept a banana accession, but yeah, this Will I or I'll ask when when I do silly conversation? Okay, yeah, let's meet up Otherwise from my perspective I put in the weekly deal review for Friday I last shot people to volunteer during the week Apart from that I think that's not much else going on with me Yeah, I part of the I'm missing all the official trainings and uh I don't understand how come I didn't see any of the reminders just the final reminder I need to double check that by the way I need double check because it's something a bit odd. I mean, I don't know also like Maybe they want to like because they have you know this like other the tab other in the in the outlook Need to double check if it didn't go there Because I'm surprised like That the fact that I missed the first one the first call for it. I'm not surprised But like the reminder is usually you know We have a look at this so yeah No, uh, trust because I get reminded sometimes So for for for our stuff right yeah, so I got reminded that you hadn't completed the fair competition training I got that but this is the one that I did That's one you've already done Not today. I yeah, no, because the one that I found yeah, I always say so you're not yeah, you're not getting a reminder for the one there's actually due Yeah The email it comes from entrust No interest learns is the email that I get it from I Don't see I'm not even sure this thing exists because when I put let me show you So here yeah When I put the name of the course I only have a reminder Everything is is something else I don't even have a first email saying that the only thing I received about anti-bribory and corruption Is actually a final reminder before Dermination of your improvements Like literally this one I see how about like what about faculty? Okay, yeah, no, that's a good point That's fair Okay See this one I'll just see yeah Yeah, it looks like it is quite a few there Yeah Okay Yeah, I think I think interest learn is not something that I read alone. I think it's just like Information that's I don't I don't really know it's it's not honestly Okay, so yeah, I just need to okay now I know I need to to open these interest learns thing is Okay If you want to I can I see you've got 1593 emails if you if you want I can do a zero inbox training session with you if you want oh Yeah, I'm interested how do we do that? If you if you genuinely interested I can show you my process Okay, yeah, I'm interested of course. Let me just verify one thing with quick I You see it's in others I knew it 22nd yeah, it's here it's in Otro That's why I don't you see interest learns I would never read this. Yeah, I think that's why it's not really it goes to others why Yeah, I don't have I'm gonna put them back to to to this so that's To the priority ones so that now from now on I received them yeah, yeah, I don't have priorities in others because I don't trust the Our look is not gonna send my important email somewhere else and How do we do that I guess someplace here? I think I just get questions I'll find it. It's okay. I look online. Yeah, oh Here you go. We just uncheck this one and here you go. Yeah, perfect. Okay good Now at least At least what I want to miss them cool but yeah, what's your process if it's the fastest process it's nothing you open everything I just read everything and delete Oh no, like I noticed you had a lot of folders and I know a lot people do that but I literally only have inbox like that's the only thing And a set up hotkeys on my keyboard so If it's something I need to do I will I have a keyboard hotkey to answer it to do list so like if an email is something I need to respond to I might not be I might not have time to do it there and then but I'll create it to do this to do this items So that I can prioritize it and come back to it and then I'll archive it as it's gone So it's on my to do this it's not in my inbox anymore If it's like those 101,000 interesting emails. I'll just delete those prematurely Well, I actually I archive everything. No, that's not true. I did delete I delete some stuff But generally I'll just archive and could add items to my to do list. That's pretty much it But I've only got four items in my inbox at the moment Because my my folders they come from back then when I use the google so we just But yeah, it's not for me. It's really it's there. It's like an archive It's it stays there so in case I need to go and look at it. You know like on demand because I know that this add only to read Expensive I report. I don't care about reading them But maybe in the future I would have an issue on a specific one and then I would like to go and read what happened So that's why initially this but the This others is why I have this like 1,000 five and because all of them are in others. I say all of them So and I never opened this that so yeah, yeah, like I used to have the problem like search functionality so good now So like if you need to define the expense file report. I would just search expense of mine and do that way Rather than yeah, so like Like trying to find to math. Yeah Yeah, I agree and I'll take care of that. I remove it Um But now I will just assume that I would mark everything as read Yeah Okay, done now I have zero and no from now on I would I'll take it away. It's fine Well, you're not someone who I've had to chase for anything so don't worry, she'll brand you know it's not like you have problems so I mean it was written I can be like terminate your employment It's a very interesting series I stopped everything goes with my phone and drop everything I was like wait a minute No, no, but yeah, because of others. It's like we just check now All of them all these reminders but they're good because the final one It didn't go to others because I think they changed the The object of the the subject story of the of the email And that's how that's how it's it's good. So it's yeah. It's well done, but it's not well done in this case of of Chasers of a reminders And in any case I sent them an email with UNCC to ask them in case it's the right one but I think so because there is nothing else But still like bending yeah by the way, I think that's yeah, so I go I'll just go say I think they got the wrong title But it probably was the fair competition one Yeah, or maybe it's a yeah probably I just noticed that I think that I think Sabrina being now the new like says leader for the X for the expansion team of CME She sent like a weekly like every Monday Is that been announced? Which I think by the way, it wasn't announced that's what's interesting So I didn't even tell her by the way cool grads because Because it wasn't announced I don't think our goes to her weekly is to be honest because now we are not mapped in this way But yeah Just if I Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't expect you to join them especially because she's expansion I've titled has been updated in Microsoft teams So And that's good prim Christina Michael Ford reports well Yeah I probably have to have a week please Unfortunately Well now it's you it's a you'll probably yeah the me problem Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm just decline it Yeah, it's okay and I saw this you invited also me I've chopped Yeah I'll tell him to just kind Yeah, yeah, so yeah, just just if we're but Other than that no, I don't think there is any other topic at the moment From my end No, I think Okay Let me know why it's given me very busy of course, but that's nothing nothing That's not something that's important like in the sense that there is nothing where I need escalation or nothing so Yeah, they just have a lot of problems You know yeah, we'll talk about next time because yeah, I'm interested like in terms of the work that you're doing and How that like fits within yeah, it's almost like a key account model like in how you work the CSM Generally, I'm interested in that so yeah, well Yeah, yeah, we can talk about it next time of course.
