FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 A Mornin Yeah, good thing. All right. Yeah. All right. Have a good weekend. Yeah. I had some friends who have come and stayed over last night. We knew them from Edward by oldest youngest oldest. Yeah. So I met them during that, and they, the lady, why, month is for a molestria. She's from Mosher, so they moved back there. They used to live in breast still, so they moved back to Vienna. But they come every out again to stay and they catch up. Still, how long are your boys, good friends with Edward? So yeah, they came yesterday, stayed overnight, still here this morning, she's got two boys. So yeah, the household is pretty, pretty manic, cameraman. Oh my god, Paul Alice, I say. It's a great entertainment for her. She is just wide eyed at like boys screaming each other. She's having a whale of a time. Yeah, it's been a pretty busy weekend. Saturday was mainly us cleaning the house to make sure it didn't look like a bomb had just gone off. Yeah. Yeah, we had a great day yesterday. Luckily it wasn't raining, so we took him to the park and they just ran off their energy. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a bit of a while. We whirlwinded weekend. How about you? We were the same last week. So our name is one of the our old name is Eland. The mom is Swedish, the movie, but Sweden. And there, so they're saying something they'd come back over for a bit and they stayed a couple of nights. And they've got a little girl, see, and they just ran and they're like super like close and stuff. So that was really nice. But like you, yeah, you spent the day before just cleaning the earth. And I thought, you haven't cleaned for us. I'll be at home. No, absolutely not. Yeah, thank you. And yeah, and also we actually sounds really bad. We had to actually clean because we'd been on a holiday and stuff. Our cleaner, they went on the holiday, so we kind of missed a few weeks. So like, I mean, we're not there to even when you have a cleaner, you still can't clean because your kids might. I helped a lot. That's like properly clean stuff, but, um, see, another feed and it's a, don't be blistered by when no one's in the house. It'll feel almost like an empty night, you know, like, for the house probably a bomb site again. So yeah, we just recessed as actually, absolutely a couple of days. Yeah, no, we had, we had, oh, it was quite nice to be a cash. We didn't. We're Charlie did. So we went to the park on Saturday on Charlie did her 25th park run, whilst being 25 weeks pregnant. So, um, so yeah, she, um, and she usually gets to install, she ran the whole things. They're like, you know, so yeah, she was super chuffed. So I just like, I just like, bootle long next to her, we've been on the prom and running prom. Nice. And then I took them in the car afterwards and I went for a run afterwards and my own. Um, um, oh, then here Charlie was out on the, like, a brunch with some friends afterwards. So me and Charlie, I mean, Nancy just chill out there in town. Um, um, then we know Charlie later on. Yeah, it was nice. And then yesterday we went, um, very picking. So we got loads of, yeah. So we sort of, we got a big lunch box full of berries from our partner. And then came back and made an app, well, raspberry and apple crumble. And it was nice. Um, I also bought a game. I've been looking at like games for Nancy to play on the Nintendo, which she can play. Because we play Mario Kart a lot. Yeah, we got a switch, yeah, yeah. But we play like, like, a big photo is not amazing yet. But she likes your play Mario. And Mario is quite good because you've been on the settings that count drafts itself. We've done the blue game as I thought. I look on Reddit and a few people mentioned a couple of games say, I got a entitled goose game, which is quite funny. Yeah, I haven't played it. Yeah, actually loved it. Like, photos hilarious. I've seen it for you in playing with that. But, um, that is good because you can play that co-op way too. He just calls in chaos. Amazing. Yeah. Me and Charlie finished it last night, that would be a bit weird. Um, so I was quite good. And then I'll just bought a, uh, the got Charlie to get a game off vintage, believe it or not. Because, um, a lot of people recommended to care being the forgotten land. And I've never played the care becomes. Yeah, but yeah, I've heard. Yeah, no, I think I've heard that one. We are a member of trying to do some research about the kiddo brewery games. And that was the came up. Another one is Yoshi. Was it Yoshi's knitted kingdom? Okay. That's just like a 2D platform like Mario, but it's quite cool art style, everything's knitted. That's that's quite good one. But yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you how Kirby goes. Yeah, I think it's one way you can like you can do co-op the min. If you're playing a one, you do more than play a 2C. You can kind of like shapper on the kid through it. It's just having us because obviously, you can't read yet. So it's trying to find games where she doesn't need to read. But that was like, so it's by brand new. Still 50 quid brand new that. Okay. Just don't decrease and they barely gone so rarely gone so obviously, yeah, really. Yeah, it's like the other games like the goose game cost me like a quid like they're all the non-intender bit make him so like super cheap stuff. But then yeah, anything that's like an Nintendo character. But yeah, Charlie, we've got we sell words of stuff on vintage or chie's got like 200 pound in credit or something. So like, so you had to look on there and manage to get like they quit. I even went in CX weekend and for about a second and it still 45 quids a calendar's like, wow, I discovered it is like, so yeah. If you want to. Yeah, yeah, exactly yeah, all my friends are just bought the new Nintendo switch the second one. And yeah, the like I think I probably will buy at some point, but the the games, because I was looking at like, yeah, some of the games like even like I've kind of stood at the cost with a switch one where like, yes, if you buy like a Mario games can be 50 quid the other games are quite cheap. But now like I think like Mario Kart is like 90 quid or something to buy on his own. But we're just doing saying yeah, there's a lot of drama about that. Yeah, because yeah, I almost got the switch to because you can buy it with Mario worlds and it reduces the cost of Mario or so and they said it was in a limited time. So far away to the cast cut cast, but then I realize I probably don't need to switch to add riddance absolutely fine to switch. Maybe in a year, because there's not a lot of games out as well. You've got Mario, I think there's a new donkey from games that looks quite cool. It's come out, but there's not much else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why I've just held off for like, you know, not really need to do it for him. Like in summer, I don't play as much because like I'm out doing stuff and whatever that's it. But if Nancy starts playing it in mind, if I could probably want to check it on me and put. But yeah, we'll see, but yeah, one of my friends got one so I'll have to see what she says. I think what she thinks it's good and stuff, but. So yeah, so yeah, that was my biggest screen. So like, I guess it's good from that perspective. Yeah, the only thing I was a bit like me and it's a proper like, like, I don't know if I've said this to a few people, a few people have been like, it looks at me as they're, I'm worrying about, I'm being a bit like, pigty. But like, it's got really big bezels. I found it really annoying. So like, because remember the first switch, I had like quite big bezels and then they brought out the old led one and that was like, a lot bigger and it's like, it's like when you look at a mobile now, you're such a nice screen when there's no bezels. And then you want to come out and yet it's a bigger screen, the handsets really big, but there's still quite big bezels. And I was like, I don't know, I just sort of like looked at it and if I was saying, my one gripe would be like, why? Like, because if you can put that technology into the old one to keep the bezels to similar sort of size, well, could I have had an overall smaller handset and stuff? But I know there's a lot more to go into it. It might be that the battery and the chip and stuff means there has to be some bigger whatever, but when you really look at it, you think, you just know that with the next thing, there'll be a new switch to, and it'll be like smaller improved bezels to a beam, you sort of like, a cynical part of me, so it's probably done that in the past, because in a couple of years there'll be the switch to OLED edition. You won't have any best links. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was by your only like little gripe with it, but that I still like, I do like the holding. It's funny, because I was never really that big into the Nintendo scene when I was a kid. I was more like a PlayStation Xbox really, but like, I do like it. I do like kind of how it differentiates itself against kind of just the noise, which is like all the other games to tell me, you know. Yeah, Nintendo's just kind of do the same thing, they like, and sometimes it works. Sometimes you get the Wii U, which, yeah, it wasn't a great success, but yeah, it is cool that Nintendo scenes to be more family focus to kids focus, which is not a great place to watch. Yeah, they have kids stuff, but then you've got like four night classes or whatever everything. Yeah, yeah, I just feel like a bit, sometimes it's like, like, I've got, I've got an Xbox, because I'd use load of out, which is to get it. Yeah, and I played it a lot of first, and then like, I've not really turned it on for like, probably two of them, so I'm not like, I mean, sort of like, I don't know, it's, I don't want to have time to, it's like, yeah, there's so much like the same sort of stuff on there, like, you know. And when I had a play on my, I was thinking less of myself to, I was later, I was playing like, what was it, what is it all mean, yeah, I'll keep it. Yeah, I've got a lot of time, like, you see things like such a good idea, and then, so, did I replay that, there's two hours, they tend to go by, like, in a flash, and there's like, oh, yeah. Probably weren't able to do that for another couple of months, like, what was the point? Yeah. Yeah, no, I got up. Yeah. Yeah, how's, how's we looking, obviously, we talked about the, what was it cool to have noticed, I was over the rest, pretty serious, that's what you want to share that with me and we can take a crack at it today. So, Angus, come back and said, it's okay, like, and like, she's like, oh, well, even if it's done by, because of business Tuesday, so, because my today's not too bad, I've only got a couple of meetings tomorrow, which aren't that bad. So, I think what I would say is without being, if this is okay with you, I'd love you to, I'm happy to just kind of like, just smash it out on my own. And then I'll drop you a message, because business today, just to tell you like, temperature check, how long I've, how well I've done. Because if I'm like, 189 to present another way through, by and today, then there's no need, and it's not going to impact my workload, because I've got two things tomorrow that, you know, and not that heavy, sir. And by doing really appreciate you, offering to help and jump in if needs people are all them. Is that okay with you, if I just kind of let you know, by and today, I'm getting on. I was really looking for something. I'll show you where I bet. That helps to find that the office there, and I know how painful these things can be. Yeah, it's funny. It's funny. I hope I get to like, I'm going to fill it in. I'm going to send some bit it, and then I'm going to tell anchor to send them an email with a very carefully crafted email from me to say, I've submitted this. Here are our own privacy impact assessment that you can see because you've signed an NDA. I'm going to call the answer. All of our responses are massively coveted because we know nothing about what you want to do. You know, and I've answered it in that way, you know, you cannot, we cannot ask, we cannot answer a specific question, because it could vary massively depending on the product you take from us. I think that's just the risk of that. Because you know, sort of like, well, if they come back and say, well, that's not good enough. So, what you want us to do, we can't talk, we don't know what to do, like you don't talk, you do it's like you know. So it's incredibly backwards way of doing, I've seen it, you know, like I've even read it anchor's email chat. And there's nothing in there, like around requirement to even give me an indication other than there's a few things, I think they reach out to anchor, like months ago and said, do support any of these things, and it was all to do with watch list. And it's sort of like very unique kind of like source sources. And anchor's come back and said, this is what we do generally across our watch list product. And there was like, yeah, well, we want to carry on talking to you. That was where she was like, like, oh, yeah, can you do this? I've seen the assessment, it's like, and they've given us a little bullshit around why the people to do it. But yeah, you might do that, but again, why you filtering out vendors via that means before you've been talking to them, because you wasting our time and you wasted your own time, because it's not just as filling it out, is you reviewing it. So you're going to go give it to a team and say, right, review all the nuances. And then in the 10 minute conversation on the next one, we're like, oh, they won't bank verification and we can't do it. Yeah, it sounds like you're like a led by a procurement team, like here. Oh, yeah. I've got that takebox exercise and it must be. Yeah. And there's some procurement teams of all the power. Yeah. Yeah, it's really frustrating. Yeah, thankfully, like said, it's not like in the height of like a busy stuff. So I couldn't, I couldn't do it, but yeah, I'm just like every time I read a question, I'm spending much, much time on this. I am spending too much time on it and just put a one word out. I just move on. Yeah. I'm usually, well, the way I'm doing, I'm going to do it is I've got like our identity security home page, public face and gun page on one screen. The questioner on the other, and then as a deep, go to basically lift in generic crap off that. And then if they ask anything more than that, then RFP or quick AI check. Is it okay, away you go? So hopefully I should fly for it. I've gotten no meetings after this and I could just crack on put some music on and. So much help. Yeah. Yeah. But otherwise I should hope I'm hoping we'll have some signed deals this week, because got some some stuff that's been going on. I can come to the world webinar or software, which is the one we've kind of. Replace and then midway through their build and they're super happy. They've been. There's webinar will software and then they've got a tech team. And the tech team have been reached out to me directly and they've got it open run in. The value of questions like really good questions like that sure. The, the, the, the, don't properly, which is good. And they were hoping to sign on Friday, but apparently they've come. This tech team, I don't think they've delivered the fall end to end thing. Whilst they've delivered the on feed a bit. So Zach was a wingin' I was like don't worry. So look, we'd now be like we can't control whether the team have developed the rest of the app on that's for them to manage. But they're not far off. When they do get there where we're built in and went to create it to the laughter sound of us. So that's good. Um, the closed April. Is the 30th or 4. Yeah. Yeah. So that should close out. And then there's another one called First Formations, which is a trial at the minute. And we had a bit of a problem last week where proof of address stopped working. Um, completely in trials. And so, but actually with managed it quite well with them, they did actually. Well, no, they might, they'd rerun the tests the following morning and it all the right behavior came through again. So they're pretty happy with that. Um, the only issue I've had with them is that they want to be able to customize documents selection for POA, which is the one I stumbled across when I shouldn't have stumbled across it because it's not released yet. No, not till the end of the month. Yeah. But we're available to test. Yeah. Well, I don't think the, I don't think the, I think it was just completely by chance that they'd asked me that question during a trial. I went and looked, I went and tested because it was one of those, but I've not, I don't do a lot of work on POA. So I thought just test my own. I was like, I could do it. I could customize it. And I was like, oh, this is how you do it. And he was like, we can't see this and I was like, oh, and then that's when the POA team were like, why can you see it? Like, send us your trial account details. So, invested bit by deployed it by accident on some accounts, only. But he's fine. I've told them that it's available under the month. Probably a soon, either just there on the side of caution, but it's come in. And the other thing they had was about putting their own logic into the validity date. And I just sent just bit just be careful because we have our own logic in there. So if you're adding your logic on top of that, just be careful that, you know, you can add it in. You can add custom logic in, but it might show the report. It should just be like the passes and then they just filter it down even further. I think they just had a bit more of a stringing one of the one to all of them to be within three months. But I noticed that a document to a bit longer. But yeah, we've got a trial review of them on Wednesday. And he was pretty happy, even with the issue we had on Friday. And then we wanted to move quite fast. We're hoping on Wednesday will be a case of we finished our testing. I think there were doing some more into Wednesday testing this turn around this week around doing the doc and motion element of it. So playing around with that, but they're pretty happy with everything else. How I do our works and through footage. So that one's probably exact main one for this quarter because it starts off around with the whole thing. I think there's quite a lot of scale with that one. So yeah, so hopefully those two will sign this week which would be nice. So yeah. So another one with anchor, which is, pericular. Pericular. That's very clear. I'm closing next week. It's 56k. Pericular. It doesn't ring. It does ring a bell. I feel like is that the one that's not really pericular. I don't know. It's weird when did I talk to them? Was it this one? I do. Oh yes. Yes. That was the reason why I don't remember that is because the lead came in on Thursday and they told anchor they went to sign by the following Monday. So I spoke to them on a Friday. I did go really well. They've got everything they need. They were like, yeah, we're really happy. And they're expecting to get back to our Monday. So I will ask her actually on my catch of where she's got with that. But yeah, they seem like a pretty legit company. They're, I think they support like, there are, there's a technology shop for businesses in developing countries basically. So it's quite a cool use case. And in a interesting market, but the, the problem they had was they only did database checks the minute and the database checks with local governments in Africa. So they've kind of like they want to move in scale. But the problem they have is understanding that they don't, it's quite unique in Nigeria. Well, in Africa that you can do that, you can make calls to databases. I have to spend a bit of time explaining to them how in the UK and other countries you don't have that gift. That's why you've got to come to solutions provider. And they were like, yeah, that's fine. We can just keep our process for how we do this here. But actually for countries outside of it, and we can explore. So, but there's a lot of nodding and like, yeah, you know, sounds like the right approach and stuff. So, yeah, fingers crossed that one sentence as well. Yeah, we're going to go to the 10th. So success. Yeah, I'll message it to see, because they were meant to get back to them on the following. They were really aggressive on wanting to move fast, but she's not mentioned it to me. So, it is one as AJ Bell episode, which was like it's closing. The truth for the closed day is the 14th. Yeah, so I've got even worse than that one. So that was one James James put a request in and he would like give me some prayer. I mean, you're just not, obviously not needed me. But yeah, funny, because I've got this SEB bank, SEB company thing with James tomorrow. And that's another one of James and it's like, they're moving to motion, but the more he told me, I don't know there's any revenue associated with it, because it's. Yeah, but 19k up, so it's not due to closed until the end of September. He doesn't think, well, the way he was saying is it sounds like they're actually doing for some reason, selfie and video, either same workflow at the minute. So if anything, I'm, we're going to be losing money, because they're going to go from two checks to one check with motion. So that's a little weird and wonderful one. I don't think there's much involved with that one either. So it is what it is. Yeah, I'll, when I'm speaking to James tomorrow, I'll ask about Edio Bell and see if there's anything else he needs. Yeah, yeah. Cool. I don't think there's anything from my side. So yeah, just, oh yeah, I've put in the weekly interview. Yeah, I've put in the weekly interview. Yeah, I've put in the weekly interview. Yeah, I've put in the weekly interview. Yeah, I've put in the weekly interview. Awesome. No, thanks mate. Yeah. Well, you do it tonight. Just look after kids. You know, they're all just a new bike. Well, such, yeah, no isn't your bike. Cause his one was, it was very small. So we bought it from Bath. So we're going to, I'm going to surprise him tomorrow. Tomorrow and we're going to hop on the train to Bath. Take it off. Yeah, I do some cycling together. No, I've been nice. Yeah. Hopefully the weather's okay, mate. And you don't get blown away with the storm. Yeah, maybe we'll just be picking out tomorrow and maybe not doing cycling. But yeah, we'll try and make a day of it. Go get some food and stuff. Yeah, so that was nice mate. Yeah. Cool. Enjoy. Yeah, and I'll, I'll speak to you when you get back. Yeah, let me know how it goes with the processes. And if it looks like it's actually going to be a lot harder than you. It's a spray just let me know. Thanks mate. All right, dude. Speak to him. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
