SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------

I apologize, but the provided transcript appears to be incomplete or may be from an informal conversation rather than a structured meeting. The content discusses games and blueprints but doesn't contain the typical elements of a business meeting (decisions, action items, assignments, etc.).

## Key Topics Discussed
- Discussion about games and their quality
- Mention of blueprints and room configurations
- Time investment in reviewing something

## Important Decisions Made
- No clear decisions were documented in this transcript

## Action Items
- No specific action items or task assignments were identified

## Next Steps
- No follow-up meetings or planned actions were mentioned

**Note:** This transcript appears to be either incomplete or from an informal conversation. For a proper meeting summary, a more complete transcript with clear discussion points, decisions, and action items would be needed.

FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 I think I had to move on to review something else, but I put a shitload of time into it. That's been a thing lately, these games were like, they're really good and you can see credits, but if you're real sicko, like, blue prints, you know, you can get the room 46 and everything.
