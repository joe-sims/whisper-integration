m maybe just amongst friends just amongst friends that's what we are I'll be twice, twice in one day what a treat what a treat hi guys hello hello hi guys hi we were just on that first legal office hours call I think it's going to be pretty useful is yeah yeah it's just like I don't need to join every way just like drop in if there's anything sort of key you want to talk to legal about I think it's going to be pretty useful I think I folded it to most of you earlier is there most of a turnout? no no yeah but then these things these things often a lie that I was telling so I was worried about having everyone on it and I think my experience people don't really tend to show up for these so yeah I think it should work no I think it will work I think we just need to know it becomes more right day they can't complain if they're not take up offers like that that's what I'm with yeah so it was pretty good well let's run through this we start with do you want to want to start with anything new because I appreciate we often miss you guys off at the end so I don't know if I didn't even bring my report up yes sure so like I guess top of mind we can just say what's going on in the team is that we are on top of our normal cadence of addressing renewals we are also working on this deprecating of the watch list and HALS product that is I guess you've heard about and that's being sort of accelerated to be finalised this September rather than in a year's time which was maybe the initial plan and so our team are helping out with creating contract amendments for customers to sign and most customers have already moved over to using watch list AML complied vantage I mean I don't need to tell you the whole story here but like that's what we're doing intensively at the moment it's about I guess 30 contracts in the may other needs addressing and less in America's an APAC probably 20 or so in total so we've decided the ones the customers that have recent usage we're addressing immediately together with the CSM's and AS of course and then any customers that have this product on their contract but are not using it we are leaving and addressing removing that product as and when the contract renews later on because there's no there's no point in just rushing with that now and we'll just leave it there's no usage and we'll remove it as and when the contract renews so that's what's going on on top of normal what sort of push back will you get from the customers that are using it and they can be left without a product yeah the main problem is that we haven't communicated it in good time to most customers the bigger customers we have via via the CSM team so like they've will have had a lot of things during the last year or so really Miguel I think but in terms of the sort of below 100k customers which is quite a few we haven't let them know in good time and so that will that's going to be a push back and then yeah it's worth doing up most of the things you'll see calling these many things it's every time there is a change that affects a lot of customers we're not that good at it I guess it's not really a clear ownership from product to maybe there's not like a program management team to take care of these things and the customers do not get happy I think it's putting us CSM's and E is sometimes in a difficult situation because we were at the space for the company and things are going that well and this is an example of we had time but the process some of these customers were missed and now we need to be running around a little bit so that all of these affects I mean it's a lot of time that CSM spend on these things and also these erodes a bit of confidence from customers because it's one after the other so that's we're trying to get improved and why do we turn this product off then what's the background of that of not being updated on that this is the watch list product yeah it's not the whole watch list product it's one variation of it yeah so we used to have a partnership with Moody's who provided it so that was what we call watch list enhanced we then onboarded which is our current provider because they have better data sources which is called watch list AML so this is the standard version that we're deprecating and moving everyone to the watch list AML product okay or what is the customer's lose then they lose something or is it an upgrade for them technically they should get better performance I don't know about cost implications but the standard was cheaper than AML so what it's the same all contrast I've seen AML that we want them to move to and enhanced have the same price per check there may be some integration changes I think it's just like the responses will be different so from that perspective they will have to do some kind of small migration yeah and we have we are able to pull in implementation services for your charge if needed from some as team we haven't needed with any single one so far on the larger accounts but it's there if we run into any problems yeah I guess the main reason we're trying to do it earlier is to save ourselves a lot of money for like over a million dollars to renew with movies for another year and so we couldn't reduce it and just renew at a small amount so that is the sort of motivation behind okay we lost some money in the one some customers when they're told you move from movies you need to go to complied vantages they've gone directly to complied vantages when they're getting better pricing and we can share a number of accounts on those that's we're losing some of that money and the other one is some of the concerns that they have it before if movie doesn't work fail over to complied vantages now we only have complied vantages if it goes wrong you lose these high availability that's another concern that's another example of a conversations that we're having with customers and is there opportunities to win the chaos of these customers like if we're talking to them about this particular scenario does it open a door to win just more standard volume anywhere else like renegotiate the rest of the contracts or anything I don't think really doesn't matter it's the respect of these migration we can always have a conversation but it's not now that we're moving to complied vantages we have an opportunity opening in general it's a negative but I mean we're saving a million dollars company level but it's we don't get that million dollars to our number yeah I'm sorry okay so anything I'm sorry anything any major renewals yeah I'll show you don't need to go into detail on this but here is all the all the Q2 renewals so it's still not booked but it's signed last week I'm not sure why it's not booked I mean either why would that be it's yeah I saw a question on the rev-up's channel I thought yeah that was being dealt with but I think there's a question I was I've been checked whether you came back on that or not there's a question from Qi so no she hasn't chased me that should have all been closed off last week yeah it's still not booked okay let me let me chase that out I don't know why that is yeah I can get a bit hard to find all the threads in the rev-up's at the moment I feel yeah which one do I want to point out Binance I want to update because I know that will likely be a short term contract till December so it'll be a full renewal rather than anything else so I'm going to remove the risk we had there in the forecast to the Binance QES I think just the the big picture is 22 million up for a renewal we have a downside number of 49 and an upside of 58 in a mail Q1 obviously was 80% and that's due to a couple of large charms that we have Revolut, Scribe, Tide a few others yeah and then you should necessarily mean the revenues gone though does it? This just means the booking is down yeah it means the booking is down and that that's exactly it and once these bigger contracts and will recognize the unused minimums but then customers will sort of write size so it doesn't necessarily need mean less revenue yeah yeah that's cool and if you have some again anything for me which is the the last thing is I mean you know the way this goes especially studios like basically increasing by 50% you have in the expectation is that new accounts most of them they're already new customers they have studio on the planets that they use studio just to double check on that one and just update that it's yeah we're getting some I mean we have this ambitious target but we still have some parity gaps plus sick versus studios so that's a constant work with products to make sure that we bridge that gap in terms of your parity he's going well I think Clarna is going to be one of the key needle movers here so Clarna we get them to to migrate and we can hit that target so yeah that's basically a bit of high level the main goals that we have for this quarter okay thank you I've just checked and Teresa was asking just to confirm pricing in the contract which is correct so I've just reaffirmed that that's all right so she can just close it as a bug map Oh thanks Oli Sorry thanks Oli yeah okay Okay so we have a quick look at this obviously a few few of us missing today but I've kept the team override the same it's pretty bullish but committing to hit our target is call to the spec that might start coming down in the middle to end this month if we're not booking some more deals best case six million basically one million and one point three million yeah this is coming So I've shifted it down based on kind of the guidance here was a couple weeks ago around 25% best case number I do I do think this is low for best I do feel that we close out more of our best case deals than 20 to 30% historically but I'm happy to kind of take a long for the time being see where this lands yeah Good much further of course What would be if it was loaded to me but the deals I've got and the pipeline company don't start pushing it start pushing it up as we get more confidence in the deals in best case yeah that's a starting point I think this is this fine and yeah if we can push it up then brilliant and rather it goes up and down any updates on So go Carlos we spoke about this morning because there is some additional risk here based on some of the time lands that we've got with them like all of the contractual work to get the additional use cases and things is underway and we think revenue wise with a very strong position it's just whether or not we can book that deal this month based on the 60th APOC they want to undertake Tapt-Up-Send top of three between the two of those that's half a million in itself and then we're going to be working on the next few weeks we'll really start pushing this beginning of September to try to get that over the line and then sum up as the other big one that one is after signature this week so we should see that close and disappear pretty soon Good good staff and then Ollie on behalf of Christian just what you're saying so you are right between basically 800 and 1.4 not too dissimilar to James I think big chunk of this is Fiona's deal is that HSC Yeah I mean it's pretty much all that yeah Okay Anything to update the group on with some of these No HSC I think the decision is going to be next week so hopefully we'll have some positive news then but I think for the next work certainly for this week that's going to remain as is Okay and then trade in two once we sort of de-risked it a bit and we sort of feel that's not moving this feature No exactly I think I think we need to recall a kind of higher band Rinsh is working on that he's only back in the office this week picking up all the JPMC stuff which is really real and I think I've got decision coming for that in the next once two weeks so I'll get into to focus on Turing up that trading two once we're up as well Okay Cool. All right. That's probably a week and go for a week. This week, anything else? Good or bad? Are you or anyone else from the colony? Anything Anything happening? I can raise something that maybe not be on everyone's radar it's quite specific about Romania and the national identity cards Yeah I don't know if everyone's aware of that kind of issue at the moment but essentially in new version the Romanian national identity cards like 2025 version it requires there's going to address on there but it requires a pin to do the extraction and that the address extraction is a part of the regulatory compliance we on Fedo and trust don't support this at a moment and it's not being prioritized until next financial year one of our customers RIFI's and has always raised it with us and said that we don't support this then they will churn or reduce their volume obviously the flag for me is Revolut who processed 2.5 million Romanian IDs so I've spoken to Andre about this just to see his awareness of it because yeah there was a large impact and having a solution available next financial year doesn't seem sensible No that's the Romanian is their largest market dock process does the pin if we solve the pin thing doesn't that give us an inter-Germany as well can't we sort of fast-addise that approach because there's a German there is a dock and pin solution there that's back and conflying Yeah it might be but I think the German solution is probably a bit more manual just because of there I don't not sure it will be like an API where we can access I think it might be to be honest I haven't looked into that but it could there is a potential that we could reuse it but for now obviously the focus is just trying to get some kind of Romanian solution What's the time line that you need for that? Well the Romanian government they're rolling out like 50,000 new cards a month so like this is imminent this is a problem that's happening now so yeah it's going to affect all our customers in Romania or operating in Romania so the timeline is actually yesterday God, okay I've got a team on that we need to do anything to to establish this So it's been, we've got a channel called Squared Customer Request where it's been raised and the RECER from the product is going on that but essentially from her perspective there's not been prioritized until next financial year so like I said I raised that with on Dread see whether it was on his radar he hasn't got back to me yet but I want to say raise it in the group as well Yeah Do you know about the Romanian regulator issues that we had recently as well Yeah about them and eventually saying that we're not fit for purpose Yeah I'm assuming that that same team is soundstaking everyone should be relevant for this now Yeah, the should because this isn't going to help our position if we're not being able to support this document I don't I don't like it so ready Exactly, yeah so like I love us even more if we can't support this No, it doesn't look like they're included in this thread I'll share the thread with everyone that's cool just so you got visibility but yeah, it could be worthwhile to get there in person Yeah So yeah, not good news that I'm sharing but I thought for visibility it should all be well Tony was involved in that and he regulates the thing so if it's same problem different or similar problem different day they probably want to know given yeah, we're really in everyone's that the importance of that market Yeah, I agree Yeah, nothing else for me Okay I'll just pinged on Dreyer then, but in thanks for bringing that up, Joe Super useful and Oh good stuff short one this week then nothing else for me All good Cool Thank you guys Thank you Thank you Thank you
