FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 I had some friends from Vienna staying over or still still having them stay over and they have two children. Two young boys, similar ages, to mine. So it's a lively household, let's say. Wow. Yeah, you can imagine. Good. How old are you? How old are you? Yeah. Yeah. Nothing major. Yes. Nothing major. Plants sailing. How's the house hunting going at the moment? So we put down an offer and then do email checks as we speak on us. Hopefully they're very slow, very slow. I hope there will be no problems. Yeah. It's amazing. It's totally things go. I hate the house buying businesses. Just, yeah. I can't imagine when the... I can't imagine when there is a chain. It's like, all the hell big clues. There's not change. Change here either way. I decided of the transaction. Yeah. Thank you for your question for you on that. Yeah. Why not? For the mortgage, you need the housing assurance. How can you get housing assurance before the transaction is completed? Because you don't have the house. Do they ask for proof? So far, no one is asking anything, but I guess you can only get housing assurance once you have a house. If you don't have a house, how can you get the housing you don't have in short? Yeah. I don't think I got it after I bought the house. Yeah. Yeah. There was, because there's no point paying for something that may or may not happen. Yeah. You literally don't have the house until the very last minute. Yeah. Payed full amount. Yeah. I remember that. It was just like, oh, you need to have buildings insurance or house insurance. I just remember to do it. There was no chair. I can't wait to have a house insurance. Yeah. Yeah. I'll do some research a bit just in case someone's going to rush me to produce something. Yeah. I guess it's worth looking for quotes just in case you find out that your house is in some kind of Oh, yeah. Flutter area. Oh, yeah. And also does it cover just the house or like the house and the garden? I believe it's the full boundary of your property. Okay. Because my wife has a kill. Oh, nice. Yeah. Right now is the storage. So the kill in the house you would probably think that there's more risk. It's a kill. It's not like an oven for. Yeah. But guys, if you put it in the garden in a shed, she'd know where the risk. Yeah. I guess I'd. Luckily those things are complicated. I remember having consistently people. I don't know what to do. Like brokers. But now it's going to be outside. So it's going to be easier. All right. Yeah. We'll get there. Of course. A packed agenda. Yes. Yes. What's that going to I just realized I know. And. Wow. I have no juice in the laptop. Oh, then. Just like not juice. It's a beautiful second. I'm going to do that. I was a morning and on battery. And I was complaining. There. Wasn't blocked. Yes. Yes, packed. There's a few things. So very quickly. They wanted to top. Yeah. Yet another interesting. And I guess challenge from the new. It just is what a is do like there's panic. It just lies is going to go to holy the e-copy and email saying for any technical questions. I'll send you a light. Well, there's not up with them. Oh, yes. There is an up. It's around them all by no time. Nothing about. Be reinvented up with Metro back like okay. But then. We're not discussing the up. You're busy. You're copying me for tech support. Yes. You're supposed to do that. But. But at the same time, appreciate the predicament because he's kind of. The point of contact if there are some needles, I guess. They don't know. The ticket they contact him or they copy him or whatever. He goes away. That communication channel. Rakes. Okay. So. Get something to. But that'll copy. So they really made me for sure. Yeah. And I will try to try. Yeah. I just sent to support. But he knows he should not have done that. Yeah. Because no, he's message me this morning. About asking about support. So I can see this two ups. One. Like. Okay. Okay. Okay. No. Yeah. Yeah. But there might be an up. But the point is that. No. It's going on holiday. No. There might be tackling it. But we've not started just about the up. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine. I will clarify. I wanted to. I have been able to explore a few things for that. Because as you could have not context, because he should have someone covering from the cat. Can't match with perspective. Yeah. You're not there for ten goals. Which I know that like people are everywhere which are generally helpful to us about. It doesn't have a scale CSM, which they should have. Additional CRM, CSM sorry. Okay. So yeah, I'll respond to that. I'm not expecting anything from them because we close the tiny, about the preparation for the big one that might come along at some point. So even now they kind of are balls with everything. So yeah, how much should we actually take the fours? Only 10k. Yeah, yeah. Because yeah, the big one, the challenge was, we wanted to push them to have a go-lap date of November 1st. And I can't, I'll challenge you. She was like, panic in a bit. You can say well, I'm not sure I can commit to that. And we had a conversation, but no, we can help you. We studio, you can do phase one with smacker. She literally used to stuff, right? Trying to cause you actually, is not that difficult, but she was like, no, but I cannot guarantee anything. So Johnny closed the tiny hole. And then the real one should be coming, and some point. Okay. So that's what happened. That's what we really account. Okay. Yeah. All right. Uh, okay, thanks for letting me know. I will message in. Well, I respond to his message to me. And then he told me, oh no, but we haven't have the bereavement of, but like, okay, we'll, I have no idea what it for. That's the reality of this class list. You're going to holiday any time that there is an op. Anyway, let's move on. That's fine. I guess about to be a pack model, then. Yeah. It's just copying me. Not even. Do you, are you aware of champions? I thought that champions in growth for foliote. Um, no, no, in general. I'm probably champions. So I guess he's just referring to SMEs. No, no, okay. Because he was, because he was like, Daniel, that is, he said, we, we have no champions in growth. And now we have in, uh, under it. I mean, talking about this. So I guess he's a new, uh, concept. Uh, I'm not very well defined by him. Yeah, I guess from our perspective, we've kind of, we've owned the SMEs. We want to be SMEs for this product regardless of whether product is happy with that or not. Yeah. So, you know, I guess this is coming from them. Exactly. So yeah. So if Daniel, say, I would like to have someone grow if we can say, oh, okay, he wants to be SMEs for, um, or if we already have an SMEs, say, yeah, they're going to be the product. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, I think they want to provide some input in what champion means. For example, in this case, he said, and I was a bit surprised. So let's talk about fully older. Um, I, I, I, I kind of knew about a deal about this product. I might have got something around about Donut about a DVR, the DVF Excel, etc. But this new product, which is for now called Good Name for the Auto, is not in roadmap, right? Interesting in roadmap. We have DVF Excel, the sponsor across a few quotes. And he said, they'll be, oh, maybe, oh my, I don't know how to, where to go, where to progress, I need to some data. Okay. I can certainly help you with that. But then in the end, he actually is going to send a survey to all growth, a very detailed survey about the data he needs. So right now, fully also, my feeling is that. And I spoke with you in, I spoke into, um, Danny this morning, I was speaking to Johnny and our, S.A.P.N.R. Every, only. And my message would then be, I'd be chatting to them, get to some data, because Daniel said, oh, why don't you talk to them? Well, there'll be some duplication, but it's not people that, but my message to our ears will be, we really need to provide some input, because otherwise we're going to get another flash, there's in for the US. Yeah. That would be my message to get prepared when the, the surveillance or good data, whether it's going to be sent to the agencies and systems. And probably it's, I can't remember. Now, did you know about fully also? I, it's very loosely. It's, um, okay. So yeah, not in any great detail. And interestingly, that they're committed to this December, 2025, was, for the one of fully old. At the same time, they want to use, they want, that is where I kind of disagree with it. They want A's to start selling flash as an MVP. And they're going to be creating a new dashboard in look with flash metrics. Now flash, and I did not know that now is a different beast. It's still flashly well. Rans don't end the VFXL, which means that apparently is going to be performing better. Okay. Now, let's see what they say about that. Now, go for circles. So this is a new product, which is great. We need a fully ultimate product. Interestingly, I spoke with Johnny, that's weak about two ops. They're going a bit south, um, transak, and envoy, because we don't have fully automated products. So very good timing. And we'll put these particular ops. We need to certify the Johnny, what to tell the customer. Now that we know that by December, we're going to get something. At the same time, we don't know what that's something in here, because if suddenly they say no, no, it's going to be phase one. You are solely, yes, you have this in product. Now, going back to the, um, you proved the product, etc, for my goals. Yeah. And I've looked again at all the new stuff that is coming through signals. It's very much focused on Central American South America. So if we think about things like adoption, I will not be able to really ever go there, because if those all those ops are going to be in the states, through the states, then I will now have much input. So my proposal is actually to swap. Now, I will simply close it work on all those things, but to kind of say, okay, I'm going to embrace being the champion for the auto, whether that means and help adoption over here, I can have more visibility. I can help people more times, for example. Well, proximity to geography is opportunities. I might have those opportunities, and I'm not, doesn't matter. And yeah, so that was that. Um, yeah, no, completely. Have you thought? Yeah. He's going to try and get a champion of the US as well. Daniel, I was going to ask probably, Caz. Makes sense, yeah. Um, that's it. Really? I will produce the final document. I will update the document. These are just thoughts and reflections on all those things. Um, I want to touch base on the conversation we had last week, I think, about the program. Caz has started in the states, for CSM's trainings. Yeah. Is that similar to what I wanted to propose? Because now Robby said, oh, let me know. I went, what did you do? I wouldn't want to duplicate efforts, compete against people, or actually tie my goal to something that might not happen all together over here. So my, as I say here, I should probably replace that thing, with something that I can control. If that thing happens, I'm happy to do it, but if it doesn't happen, then at least I've got my primary activity, whatever that thing, I don't know what it is, but I think you maybe should come up with something else. Yeah, but the, that training of the Caz might be rolling out. I assume that's training just for US CSM's. Yeah, perhaps. So we still have the issue, like, of the Amira CSM's, not being trained up. So it might work just double checking, but I'll be very surprised if the scope is international. Well, I'll check with it. But it's actually quite a good, it could be a good segue for us. If, if that's happening in the US, then that could open the door for us to say, oh, there, yes, S is it doing this? Would you want the Amira S to do something similar for the Amira CSM's? So yeah, I think we can utilize it and actually kick off this kind of training program. I keep seeing massive gaps in understanding this is again similar to one I described recently. This was Sarah CSM. And it's, we were talking with BitSdownb and there were needing some bi-oly verification issues, but having the document, it's also to the out week, I gave them the advice that they were happy. But it just soon, them, for bi-oly verification, if you had only put the face into the system, the new system, the TKT, the motion, only works if the user and border bi-oly provider was she meant was like, if you have a bunch of documents, right? Yeah. You cannot use authentication motion. So, and that is not the case. So, yes, it's a new product, but there are so many assumptions floating about between CSMs and this morning with such it was so confused about AES. It was going to present to XDB this week, and the sign-to-use solution for AES. And we have it in studio now. So, we did a know that we did the work and it is available now. There's no need to go back to the sign-to-solution. It was going out. It was talking to sign-to-says to tell AES through us. So, all of it all amassed. Yeah, maybe it's us, or what special it is. And we sometimes have gaps, but I understand that people outside of a team have massive gaps about the product. Yes, they do. Some of the best in others, some not so good. The baseline is all over the place. Well, the baseline, I think perhaps as low as the issue would be. Okay, I'm trying to think of the best way forward. Can we have a citizen-able mode to a AES? We did. Okay. I can't remember. Yeah, we did. I was trying, and it was from an on-field of a respective level with an in studio. So, yeah, so we were ready at the, let's say, desired solution. Yeah. With a component since the student. Exactly. It wasn't like a theoretical piece. Yeah, or future. Okay, well, okay, great, okay. But I just don't, I don't think people pay attention or join those in every session. It's like, I'm saying a lot of examples where yeah, this is very high level. It's not like what Sarah is understudy, which is perfectly fact. That's super technical, right? It was like, how do I sell AES? Do I need to engage a sinus AES? What's or it's just another thing in studio? Yeah. It is the latter, but it didn't know about it. So that was learning. And I told him in people forget it was the name of the rising tool. CPQ. CPQ, as you must have the S can you, the, the, the, the entering in the tool is how I don't know. That's fine. Yes, we need some people to be up to scratch. Yeah, so in terms of next steps, do you want to reach out to cars and try to find more information about what CSM program or training is doing? And then let's let's speak again and see it. Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, I remember, probably asking him the questions I wanted whether was just a question there or there was a full, I'll ask him anyway, I've been good. Yeah, good. So, um, I tried to formalize both those things a bit better in the, in the draft document that I have for the goals, also find just a final thing. On the 10% to personal one, I think I found what I want. Okay. There's a cost, there's a price tag attached here. You let me know if it's too much or so low, but tell us out of this guy, Daniel Goldman, he's actually the guy who not necessarily invented the concept, but is the guy who, uh, is a professor sociology at University of Abelblad. And is the guy who, popularized the field of emotional intelligence, right? Yes, it's the, is the OG. And the book they wrote in the discord emotional intelligence. And of course, he has a website and it's got a couple of options. It's got cohorts, sessions, which I don't want to do because I read the data in last year at the video. They can go south very quickly or they have the south-based course, which if you do the four courses, it's six hundred dollars and the four courses are basically, it's a critical room, but it looks like it's only three, but actually, I think it's, um, four, there you go. Fonditional skis one and two relational, evasion of skis one and two. So this is, this is it. To help package, then ours, and it's open for a year, I think, the link. And the interesting thing is that this one, it's got materials from him. Whereas these ones have these other people delivering the course. That's it. I'm on board. Let me just share this with you. Yeah, so I think there'll be kind of two questions would be like, what, like, what do you hope to gain from it? Like, obviously, to, yeah, broaden your experience in emotions, intelligence, but I think if there's something like the concrete that we can say that, I know it's persons about them. Yeah, how it's going to also impact your performance. Yeah, I think is, I, yeah, I can tell you now, I can't really believe right, but what I find is that oftentimes, both in turn and externally, I write things or say things during a conversation, and then I regret saying that, not because I've sent up the land of land just things. And how could it have done better? So it's all this self-reflection. Almost every lineage, like, I could have done this better than that, etc. So business like a step into, possibly, have less of these, from in Asia, not because they're not valuable, but because I'm making less, not mistakes, but like, understanding who you're talking to could be internal, external, I relate to them, etc. Any performance, so, um, once you say a thing, you cannot be taken back, right? Yeah, in a common sense, you're a customer, you say the wrong thing, but not again, not like, stupid things, as a side, but, you know, maybe not understanding, but they're coming from and you say, well, equitable, equitable, that better. I could have taken that and bought in a different way, but I could have just stood on the spot and given an answer based on my understanding, as opposed to them, maybe only ten minutes later, I said, oh, they meant that, right? So for me, it's all about that, increasing the performance of conversations, right? But it could also be a sink, right? After a conversation, you reflect, but using new tools and abilities, that's my take on that. Perfect. I've never done something like this, so, so precise on this. Cool. I just quickly checked, wanted to make sure that LinkedIn learning didn't have any Daniel Goam and emotional intelligence. Okay. It doesn't. It has lots of emotional tension courses, but they're all just random. Yeah. Like for me, like, I'm just anticipating challenges, like from end to end. Oh, yeah, yes. So the fact, no, I mean, I've never been established in this. Yeah. Okay, so I can share the link of course. There's the only program related with them, there's single smart of combos, the yes, single model, which is the one I chose, the column, the left, feature, don't know, God, the man is collaborative work. You know, this is putting his name to this, and I'm hoping that this is the best place around. Yeah. I must human, this, this, this website is not complete hack, or fraud. I've checked there wasn't on EDX and courseera and the bit dodgy. What I could do, clearly, I can search a LinkedIn before you ask anyone, and if I can find something that sounds good, maybe I can try those. Because I was at the Leave it through and trust. Yeah, we have access to LinkedIn learning. So like, yeah. But from a selfish point of view, I want to try and get you this because I want to kind of test and trust willingness to develop people. So I'm more than happy to kind of like, trying to request that. Yeah, you got two links now. Yeah. You didn't need the week at one, but you know, it is the guy. So that's why I thought that's nice. It's supposed to rehash of or to come, so I'm hoping that he had some input into the website. If indeed, if you feature in the course, you will have had something but for you. Yeah, absolutely. Like, given it's an asynchronous, supported, just some recordings. Like, it might be entirely in. Yeah. Oh, no, I think that's great. Let me take that away. You know, if they push back hard, that's fine. I think as you say, I didn't think about LinkedIn learning. I'm sure they're sobbed in valuable there. Yeah. It's not going to be the same quality. Um, no, yeah, I'd like to try this approach. So, uh, let, like, it may not even go to interest. It might be, I'll speak to Robbie, Robby says fine. Let's do it. Let's expense it. Like, LinkedIn came back with the expenses, but so yeah, let me speak to Robbie first. Yeah. In fact, the LinkedIn learning, most of the courses we did for the leadership academy were pretty good. Yeah, the videos. Yeah, they were, yeah, they're not. They weren't all. Quality was this. Some was good. No, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But you can't, like, he is, like, say the OG of emotional intelligence or like popularizing it. So, to do a good, that's why him would be better than someone just rehashing potentially his words. Cool. Well, um, I think I don't have anything else. I'm going back to fully auto. I mean, if this is serious and performs, that could be a game changer. Yeah, speaking to James on this morning and he's, oh, yeah, he seems to, he said he was speaking to you later. Yeah, yeah, he's saying that there's just so much competition out there offering, yeah, it was amazing. And customers seemingly don't care about their performance degradation. Like, obviously, there are some customers. Yes, some customers. The fact that we don't have an offering is starting for the purpose. Yeah. And we need to see what before my integration means. So, you might have had in mind, flash rewind, point one, which is not what we have now. We've doubled call flash rewind point two. Because that flash, I remember that product say, don't use it outside of the US, right? But it's now diagnosed as none of these flash we have right now is better. And I think no one knows about it. It's been not been, I think it is, Donatan, DF, DF, the DVF Excel has so recent. Yeah. And back in features that, that if you people understand what they do, anyway, so good. All right, Jason, you have anything? I don't have anything for you. Okay, good. That's fine. We have a weekly deal review on Friday, the patent, ask for volunteers during the week. Probably not yourself because you already don't want. No, no, yeah, yeah, I'm not going to go over. I'll wait for the full set. Okay, cheers. Oh, what did you make? Yeah, if you got, if you're a hot stop, I think I have, do I have anything now? I have no, no, no, I have three o'clock. I was, I know we briefly talked about it last week, but obviously the session with Simon and get lab. We didn't discuss much about what we've got. It was, to be honest, so what they put up is my blowing. It's so like, yeah, advanced revolutionary using all those tools, inexpensive or open source of whatever clearly they are very agile. What they do, right? You can tell like, they're like, although they are, how many people? 10,000? No, three thousand. I think it's at 3000, almost 3000. Are they way they move? It's like the way of you to move to where we were at 300. Which is amazing. I think that I was contrasting that in my head between them and interest as an organization, right? Same people, same number, exactly. No, yeah, I just wanted to, I didn't push him, but I don't think you're probably, I didn't articulate in my question very well. My point was, this is fantastic, but all the things you say in a like, so my question was, we look at, you cut down all the time, but what is the quality of the output? Are you even measuring? If the measure is like before it took them two weeks, now it took some two hours. Amazing. Yeah. But that output is usable as the one that was produced in two weeks. That was my question. Yeah. That was my cure of the year. Yeah. And you have to somehow compare the two. No, it's really cool what they're done and it's like, when you think they're not as big as companies interest, but I think their revenue is some like in the same region, like they're almost a billion, like we are. And yeah, like, that their business is simple and then trust right, entrusted to like six companies in one, these three things, they just do one thing, get love. And another, the system might be a bit brittle though. I think you mentioned that. So depending on this is a series of prompts, right, in the former profile, in the former negative prompt, positive prompt, but it's a bunch of prompts. Yeah. What if you remove one month file and it changes dramatically? What I said was interesting was about how you change those things, right? Never change to agents. Models one after the other. Use them in isolation, get the outputs, and then maybe use another one. Yeah. I mean, it's yeah. Oh, and they're said the SLT team will do something. What does it mean? SLT. SLT. Some DevOps. So SLT means entrusted SLT. So like yeah, what? Apache. So RSLT. Oh, yeah. I think he's meaning like SLT of interest, like Patrick's Steel, Kelsey, I can't remember all this. Well, literally the acronym is senior leadership team, to team. I was thinking about something like something I've obviously, no. So this again, I could slot this in into my goals. If I could do anything on the ground, I don't know what that is because I think we are very, very early stage. So I could put a place all the right. I would be yeah, very willing to help replicate basically we need to replicate what they had, right? We're different tooling, but in the end, we need to get us something pretty much. Yeah. So but I suspect I will have obviously should be doing that. The people who maybe know put together Salesforce, automations and things like that. You'd hope so. But I think I can consult and help and advise and search and whatever I'm around. So maybe I should put that as a kind of a placeholder in my goal to say, hey, does this project initiative, does it like project anonym yet? Let's finally find out more from my drive on Friday. Okay. Okay. Because I don't know. We haven't synced on Friday yet. I think I've been in the past. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Let's talk then. Yeah. I'm really excited. I would be just proven. No things work. I'll see. Super happy to be but again, so for the SDRBDR thing, it can be precise. Yeah. A bit. Right. So yeah. I guess you need what is accuracy there? We need to define that as well. Yeah. But also, let's think about how it helps us, not just driving leads. Like he was mentioning obviously the SDRB or the SDRB. They use this to do research, supplement their account plans. Yeah. That's the accuracy that we can let. Though actually. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. Absolutely. I was just thinking about that because yeah. We need to think about what we do today manually and how we can improve on that. Yeah. Because what other processes that can be approved? Because one of the fascinating things I thought was that he said they use voice recordings to then or to master get update their customer success plans as they call them. And like, obviously work some pre-sales. So that's not a post sales thing. But customers success or some athletes, maybe think of post sales. But like we, I think on Fido and Trust, I'm very good at one account planning or customers success planning. Like, and if we could also make that, like through voice recordings that get transcribes, which then that important parts of that go into subcode document that says, this is the customer and this is their landscape. This is what they want to do. And this is what we as the SDRBs have kind of fed into that and this is what we're driving towards. Like, we didn't have any of that really. Now, I remember it also said though that they compared those recordings. The outputs from the process of these recordings within manual notes still. Yes. Yeah. You said that they compare that. Yeah. Yeah, the change will be and yeah. The, I mentioned that the elevations, one of the prompts is that if you do not know from, if you have no information, please do not hallucinate basically. But tell me explicitly that you don't know. Yeah. So it seems like at every step of the way you need to kind of minimize as much as you can that hallucination. Yeah. I think the hardest part would be getting that prompt right. So like you saw his prompt is very large and I imagine that's come through many iterations. Oh yeah. Yeah. And also, yes, I am noted the, um, I made a note of the prompt sink and engineering page. This one, I will go, I will go through that. This one. Oh yeah. Yeah. Now, is about Claude, but the principles I can be applied as a weapon. Yeah.

It's not actually available. Uh, it's either Boston. Okay. Um, right. Get prompting tutorial. So you probably have to make a local repo and then spin it up. But I'm going to try, I made a plan to try and do that that this week. Oh. I've enjoyed not many mice. I've enjoyed. Thank you. Yes, I did not click around. Yeah. So we would basically, um, co-pilot.
