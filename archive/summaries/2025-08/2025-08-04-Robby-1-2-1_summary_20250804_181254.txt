FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 I'm sorry, I'm late, I just have running with Superam. I was, I was going out there, what are the five kids? They are at a museum at the moment in Bristol. My wife keeps texting me and it doesn't sound like she's having a lot of fun. I can imagine, I mean, is her and one adult with the five kids? Two adults, so the moment the dad of the other children. Okay. But it sounds like the mom isn't feeling well and yeah, I don't know. It doesn't sound fun. Good level of drama. Yeah, I can't wait till they get back. Yeah, I can't imagine or they're thinking the same. How you doing? How's the weekend? Good. We can was good. Yeah, no major event. Is that the fact that the guy was supposed to finish installing the doors? The next round from Thursday onward, including today? Just another week. Is that the last thing or? When you finish that, we realize that I'm missing parts so I can't really finish everything. Even if you keep saying, I was going to finish the kitchen by Tuesday. It's not going to happen. At least get into the point where you can look around and say, oh, actually, I need these 17 pieces that need to come from the factory so I can confirm to the factory what is needed instead of thinking, yeah, fine. I'm going to finish it. There'd be a good stuff to decide that. Nothing, but I'm only exciting. You know, and this is done. I cut the grass. Nice. That was achievement. That's good. I've been managed to do that. The guy lies. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing more. Cool. I saw. Yeah, I forgot to answer that message about the CSM. Oh, yeah. I saw you responded on Thursday. Yeah. So. I mean, no major surprises, but yes, this concept of where 40 people. The customer facing that they're just shuffling around. Doesn't seem like the best use of their time. What's the customer? I mean. Yeah. What the value. Yeah. I will see what the cast says. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, don't take this. I'm sorry. That tried anyway. But I have a question. And so. Patrick T. That we have to spend sure. Lovely days within New York from tomorrow. Nice. He drops there. Something like, yeah, you know, we're going to risk acts in September. Can you train me or calling on the day of the cat us? We can show it. It was like, you don't have an SC. No, it will just have to tick it. I have to buy my own ticket to go. But do we have a stand? So yes, we have a stand. Apparently that comes with only two slots. One is calling one is I don't know. Call it. So I'm going to speak with calling our call in a me. I repeat. I'm going to speak with him next week. Very Friday or next Monday. But do you have any visibility on events? Because I know me. It was going to few events in September and October. Do you have a visibility of what events are going on in the me now? Do we need people where we are? Don't need people even if the event is going on. Yeah, so. Mirko, you mean to. There's a marketing coordinator. So there's five events happening. From September, October, November, I think. So, most of the dreads, Romania. Milan and Rome. And I've got SCs going to all of them. You have the list. Yeah. You're sure. Yeah. Oh, like whether I need you or not, who knows. But I see it is almost as a perk to the job for some of the essays. Like, I know. Gibran wants to get a motor. Why not? Although it feels like we've got, I think we've got a James Swan going to that. Mirko, Johnny, anchor. Seb. And Gibran. Okay, into the motor event. Seems to be excessive. I think it's a big gaming conference, right? Not. Yes. Yeah. But I'm not sure it needs six people. And then the same event is also happening in Rome. Yes, sigma. Which we're going to both. We're going to both. We're going to both. We're going to Rome. Maria. Okay. I hate. I'll look. I'll look one drive. Because I think the risk acts event in Rome is not in the list. It's on the 10th of September, more or less. Okay. It does. It sounds like it's being coordinated by marketing, which is a Patrick toberin. Special. I have no idea. It's a classic special. He asked me to explain the storyline to us when showing the demo. Like, if he doesn't know that we don't have one, and that's why we're going to New York tomorrow. So it was like, is it the joke? Like. I see my arm. I can't get it. It's gone. Yeah. More banking. Secure payment. I'm afraid. I'm going to go. So why you said. You said you're brand. Because the last big Spanish. It is. Yeah. That was a why not me. As is. Kind of still in the Spanish. Anyway, should you banking summit brass of what is brass of Romania? Okay. So that's why I'm here. Only pagamente. Angle the mirror. When Daniela is Daniela happy to go. No. Yes, me. It's like, wow. They mainly speak Italian in Milan. Like, this event. So ideally, we need someone Italian. So, yeah, I managed to convince Danieli. Do we have a stand? I think so. Yeah. I'm. I'm going. I might go to. Okay. It depends if I'm in Chicago or not, but. Yeah, I mean, probably. It's better if I don't understand. But if you didn't have a stand. I'll say maybe if I go and I confirm we can spare Daniel. If he's not happy to go. Okay. Yeah. I'm sure it'd be happy with that. Oh, yeah, let's see. I mean also because otherwise. I don't know if I go. If the. Daniela is at the stand with me. We don't need to. I see this. But the same time. Probably you can demo stuff. I don't. Sigma. Central Europe. Okay. That is the same. Yeah. Anca. My name is going to. Okay. Yeah, there is this risk. Axe that is an event with master. Carl has actually the master. The club. Many vent, I think. I don't know. X. X like the X and a. Risk. Yes. How was it? So who is the. I think 10 and 11 a. So that's September. All back. Who is coordinating this list? The lady from marketing. Entrust. Global marketing. Someone on our side. Yeah. Christie. Our. I'll fold you. I wish you want to email. I should. I'll fold you. I wish you. I wish you. I wish you. I wish you. I wish you. I wish you. I wish you. Yeah. I may be asking directly. Is there other events where should you reach out to the director? Yeah. So she said she's something this. So she's the real. Yeah, she just comes to me. So. But. Yeah. The fact that I'm on the booth. Are we fully trained to a defect them? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I'll try five hours on the gaming industry. Yeah, what are the techniques? Yeah, okay. Cool. So yeah, we'll. Maybe I picked this up and it's. And I check with her. I see this. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah. You can now go myself. Because I mean Greece. Otherwise I would say they go because Mastercard identities not really. Something will end up in somewhat. Where is it? Rome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess in our team, then you're the major, the most experienced master code. All right, nobody's an experienced master because like that, I mean, we can play in someone. Also, yeah, that would be a piece, but we need to have a full story, it doesn't include side V otherwise. Yeah. Riskaxe, then Rome, let's see. Yeah, master code, this is really, I think, organized by all is a very sensual tell, world or story, I'll tell Rome. Now you're interested. Yeah, so I need to be in Greece with the house with the kids. Anyway, eight and nine of September. Always. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, well, thanks. Thanks. We've gone from there. Any other thing on the other side. Sorry, one of the speakers is a BBC breakfast presenter. Sure, I never was in my life. The only BBC is an absolute sorry Simon. Oh, yeah, true. Oh, and maybe Steven Bartlet might be appearing as well. Do you know who he is? Is that Steve Boller? Is Bolle made by Microsoft guy, right? No, it's the diary of a CEO guy, the popular podcast. I heard that, but never listened to. Yeah, it's not like it. What else? Get lab guy. Yeah, I don't think we spoke about that. Yeah, what do you make of it? Interesting, I think it was a, yeah, definitely good overview. And it's good to hear that would be an effort and then passed to actually. I should implement something similar with an executive sponsor. It's money behind and the prioritization because otherwise it's one of those things is like, yeah, okay, we'll just still use paper. In other words, so good to know, but. How much more than that? Yeah, no, it's an interesting thing and then I spoke with Andrea just after that and. I don't really, Tony really wants to push on this would be an executive dedicated. It doesn't know if it's going to be a new hire or. One internally. That's going to be. AI that or whatever. No, I think that's going to be a title, but that idea thing. I hope it's someone. Tony one ever. Not like someone who exists on the S.R.T. someone else. I hope so I hope to otherwise would be someone that. Yeah, like. Can't even spell. So. So, ever be interesting. Don't need to think. So from the last point of view is as soon as this is confirmed, we want to lead the challenge on our side that are gathered as of how things move on the other operation. And so on with defining what is the first use case we try to embed. So that could be an interesting one. And they're being the, the chatting with the upper reach. So we also spoke with Andrea thing outreach. Have this guy a tool. And I think the selling point of outreach is probably a bunch of those work flow integrations with the CRM and so on. I already there. So basically because outreach is probably on topic. Yeah. A point to Andrea was like, even all of those things, if you go for the route of one or have full flexibility and decide what to do, you don't need any of those two. You check the teams recording. In on topic. Yeah. And then you build the workflow you want because outreach will do that with the difference that if they didn't embed the integration with Slack, for example. You don't have it. Yeah. And then you have to do anything about that. So, yeah. We need to see and also think it's like, I don't know when you start being investing one path is difficult to change right. If you go six months without reaching your lies, actually, is missing some of the future we need. Like, now we're a bunch of staff built. There may be ultimately if everything goes in in Salesforce, it's fine. Because you just need to build the logic and the connector, but the content itself. We created a route range tomorrow. We created where your workflow is to say, it's first doesn't change. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't really looked in Salesforce. But concern there is they, I wonder if they're going to like restrict what you can do in Salesforce because they have agent for us. So, I'm sure that rather we bought agent for us to create some kind of process ourselves. I don't know. I mean, thinking about the guy from GitLab, since like they can ingest back everything they wanted says for us. Did I use Salesforce to get lab with? Did he say that? I can't remember. I said they use it. I don't know if it was an example for us. Because he got to the fact that, you know, you bring back and you basically can create just a link in Salesforce to the analysis for that account and link to the account plan. It referred to having a link in your CRI. And the use says for us. But I don't know if he was making it as an example for us, but for them is GitLab itself. The only reason I'm doubtful is because I think one time we spoke he said that they created a CRM in GitLab. So they just created like the spoke CRM using GitLab. But I don't know what that means. They don't use Salesforce at all. I don't know. That's also what Andrei was saying in the call. Do him. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. No. So a lot of depends on us getting some kind of executive buy in and I feel painful just getting any kind of security backing. I've been trying to get the confluence API, but just so I can read some analytics. But even that feels like it's going to take forever. Yeah. And I said the same thing. Andrei is like, if they put this plan in place and this executive has on the ocean is to open door for us to be able to play around with cannot move at the speed of interest. Yeah. To pile up the use of AI. Because by the time we have something out, it's going to be irrelevant like. Yeah. It seemed sounded optimistic. Yeah. It's pretty good. But in that case, what do you think would be like would be something you would be interested to lead or Daniela would be interested to lead to lead? I spoke to Daniel. How do I want to want them early? And I laugh the last thing I've talked to him about was get live. It was very impressed. Like, of course. Yeah. I think it changed his perspective on how it's being used. I think he was quite skeptical before. Like, of course, he still would like to test it and make sure like he still thinks I was risk of hallucinations, which is true. So yeah, I think he would be interested. But yeah, personally, I'm very interested in these types of things. Like, I love playing around with this. So like you, obviously. Yeah, I've got a personal interest in that. I would like to lead it. But I don't know whether that's being selfish or not. Yeah, because I think Daniela, the problem I see is that. To. I can clearly pragmatic on what can be done, what cannot be done or these are things that are going to go wrong. So this is the makes sense because I want to see if there is an hallucination and they make it pipe in the name of that person because there is. J dot. It's John by his actually James. Then the person doesn't respond to what he made. So I think. Yeah, I don't think yes, that's flexibility of. Time to make something and then break it while we make it, right? Yeah, that is what we might need. Yeah, I think he would be like regardless of who he'd like to be involved, which is fine. I think he's in that would be valuable. Yeah. Yeah, I think we'll be I mean, we need the technical side also putting up all those different work flow and so I don't know. I mean, might take a bit of time or not, but probably might because it's trying that you don't work and blah blah. And then there is the business side of kind of use case we want to build out with vision. If you think about that, the product management side building a product that is an automation thing for the sales force. So what are the future? What is the use case? How we envision a simple people to use it? And then there is the path of out now we build it. So. I could even be the. I mean, I think it's a split, you know, if he's like you and the Niele together working on that. Yeah, because obviously from Simon's presentation, it's obviously not just solution architecture is the entire sales or like. And just to know how much you got involved in like the SDR being the other stuff, like I'm sure he would have to get buy him from their leadership and. And then expect Simon's. An expert in kind of outreach or. So yeah, it would involve cross cross department organization. Yeah, I mean, might also be that he has been told look for the SDR. This is the problem one solved. Yeah, I'll pass putting something together that solved that problem. Yeah, true. Right. So. Yeah, I put in the catch up for Friday. So. Interest to know what Andre wants to do in terms of next steps or like. Either way, I'm interested from the respective regardless of what the outcome of this is. I know we have to work with the confines of interest, but sure, I'm sure of the things we can do. Like I don't know with all the right thing now, how much could be the value compared to the amount of time to just navigate around. Yeah, sure. Yeah, you can't really drive full adoption and then you make something that is nice for three people. Those three people will use on topic on the run if they want, right? That's my concern is like. Spend a lot of time to build something that then. Has already got used to be here. It's limited that doesn't have. Push from the top. Yeah, sure. Even a simple thing, there's lack. There's lack about the provider and answer. That would be amazing. If you can just imagine you can just ingest our confluence, public documentation and the slack history of the last three years. An RFPIO. Yeah. Like you realistically have nothing to do. Like 90% of the answers are there. And like literally, I think that could be spun up in a week. Like you need slack API confluence API. Some context from our public documentation, which is all available in GitLab. Was the last thing he said, I think that was it. And yes, slack API. So like using. No, yeah, you forgot one. You need the entropy API. And thought. Yeah, that was the other one. There's the piece. There's the piece we need. Yeah, would I like. Yes. No, I think it's probably easiest again, I'm talking API than all the other ones. Like, I imagine we'd have to. I know. Break into securities. House to get a slack API. Like, I think they locked that stuff down. Like anything in town, it just feels like it's impossible to get. But the thing is, yes, very achievable. It's just interest as the blocker. Yeah, and that's why I mean, at least there is a change of direction from the top where they try to open this door. I don't want to spend. You can't spend months just to get access to this slack API. And then another month for the confluence API. And then I don't give you the one about the public documentation. So you're kind of stuck. Yeah. I guess like any kind of business case, if you're lead by what the ROI is, like, I wish it's hard to measure. But if we say get lab, they've seen these if they can improve. And reduction in time to generate leads. And that's probably what's going to make them stand up and notice. But yeah. Yeah, there would be an interest in. Also, kind of. Closing this key gap and knowledge gap with the CSM. So now they have someone that can go and ask every time. Or we could just replace the CSM with agents. Yeah. That may be not. Yeah, okay. I think I'll try to hopefully also get some update from Tony side. And we'll know it from Tony's to us, but like probably it would be. Positive. Okay. So then good news, bad news. I'm glad to give you a net up on the promotions. So Gibran should be approved. Michael not. Mostly because he got to approved out of the one I requested. And in the list priority, it was Austin and Gibran. So I told him this becomes a challenge. Not necessarily now because anyway, we don't communicate anything until September. Yeah. I become a challenge. If by September, we don't have a path. It doesn't necessarily needs to be the open role tomorrow for him. But a formal path we can make clear to him of possibly moving into leadership position for the. For the scene in the me. Yeah. So. You took note of that. Yeah, Grace. I look. Is doing a good job and just being in the role for years. So. Yeah. No, obviously he'll be disappointed. But. Yeah, I get it. I can't for my everyone. And Gibran is probably the more well rounded. If I had to pick one of two would have been Gibran. Yeah. Yeah, I've got time to. So. Yeah, I mean, still a bit of time because I want to understand. I mean, I also have the same issue. Different issue by name pack manually posted and get promoted. Yeah. So that would be another one. Interesting. But then the reality. I mean, that truth is, I have to choose who to lose. Yeah. That is five. Manually wants to leave. Yeah. I prefer him than Jabran. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. No, I'm happy that Jabran is goes promotion. I think deserves it. Not that anyone has doesn't. Okay. Yeah. And. I mean, things go as they should anyway, the promotion of Michael. We've been. Am wrong. Yeah. And that side. I have to then move him in the list. Yeah. So now there's still time. That they opened the conversation about the packages. Two weeks, I think. Okay. Try days. But there will be. All that. Yeah. That was interesting. Raising when Shane was saying, you know, these are the pre approved promotion. So I challenge us. Like what does it. So these are the only promotion. Like it is pre approved. And it should say no, they say the pre because it's before discussing the packages. Okay. It's always before something. That's not like. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, I think globally our org. I don't know. And that was telling me like Patrick's org is excluding. And the rest piece for eight people have been promoted over all. Total. Pretty low. Yeah, we'll have better number clearing. When we get closer, but yeah, this is what it is. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Anything else from my side. Okay. Then yeah, I saw. Yeah, I found you risk. Yes, in your calendar. When I wrote it was. I was on my. So I couldn't open your calendar. Okay. And then I wrote it in case I forgot to do it on Monday. I did. What else. Yeah, so make sense. We can use that time to discuss after you have the SPS feedback. Yes, I have not even thought about goals yet. I've been. Like, obviously I'm focusing on my team, but. Yeah, I think it's the key because. I think we left them in a bit in a draft stage. And now I want everyone to kind of read them. Acknowledge read the letter. And think what are they doing for the level that expected? Yeah, I think most of my team have updated their goals. Based on discussions I've had with them. Like. Gibran said would review. Will he reached out to me and said does this change the goals that we set? And I said no, no, it doesn't, but we should review the career ladder to make sure that we're not missing anything. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah, I thought. I could quiet this month. How is the team doing workload wise? Do they have anything to do this month or. Now focus on self-learning and stuff. Yeah, it seems generally quiet. Like there's little opportunities here and there. Oh, yeah, sorry, before I forget. Daniele said like for his personal development wanted him to find some training courses that you might be interested in. And if they cost them, I'll discuss that with you in which kind of see whether we can justify it. He has found one. And it is about emotional intelligence. He's given a justification why applies to work. Obviously, his personal is like his own development as well as having more business context. There is a course that he has found. He did lots of research, but I think it's about $600. So I don't know. I'm happy to try and put forward a business case to get it approved. Which kind of courses in person or a mod? No, it's it is asynchronous course. It's four courses. He liked this one better because it actually had Daniel Goldman, who's kind of the person who popularized emotional intelligence. Whereas the in person ones have like specific trainers. So it's an asynchronous one. 10 hours in duration. And what what is a band? Is that a certification or a test or a size? Yeah, there's some accreditation. I don't know whether there's any tests, but it might just be participation. Trying to see shadow link. I suspect that some kind of test towards the end of assessment. Okay. Yeah, I think if there is a light business case, at least you can send me with some information I can run it on that. Understand if we need to put the proper business case in or not. Yeah, but at least kind of one page or alpha page actually would be. The same. Yeah. And this is how does it fit with its goal? And we will mark him as. I don't remember the problem medium potential just because it's a level of super high already. But definitely it's like. Out of what do we do to retain this people? Exactly. Like he's not necessarily going to get promoted anytime soon. This would be a good. I think he would enjoy this and keep him motivated so rather simply inexpensive. So yeah, that's fine. I'll put together something I've kind of warned him that we'll need to justify it. Yeah. Yeah, at least I mean something small to start and then check with and I for need more. Yeah. Yeah, no, the team. Yeah, like I encourage them to do like there's lots that they could do in terms of. Personal development or learning more about the products like we have by the bio master cards, sign how so there's lots of practical things they could do. But most people seem comfortable that they have enough going on. Cool. Good. And go and need to track on. Platform line of business. The only update why there are new logo that didn't adopt studio. And they start looking at those. They're all not new logo. So I don't know how they run that number. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, thanks. And then I mean, I'm in New York and on the plane basically today's out of three. If something comes up just ping me. I think I will have a Wi-Fi probably. Okay, I'm on leave tomorrow, but I'll be around for the rest of the day. Yeah, cool. Thank you. Cheers. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
