I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. So I... To be honest, there is a risk that they might find somebody else for Brazil. Yeah. But I don't think that for the rest of the business, I don't think we should worry. I think they just want to see what's going on in the market. Is that okay if I sign this? Because he's from... Yeah, yeah, no, he's not. I think the deadline is not till second week of September. So it's... Yeah. And it hasn't even been issued yet. No, it hasn't been issued. And it's... I don't think it's going to get issued any time soon because they're all on holiday. But yeah, we'll see. It's going to be fine other way, right? So, yeah. I'm usually proactive from Primm. Usually I would typically expect the RFP to have already been issued like a couple of weeks ago and deadlines tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, it's very... I think... I think somebody is looking at what he's doing. That's my feeling. Because he's very, very active with wheelbanks. Like he's on holiday and he's checking slack, he's checking WhatsApp. So he's weirdly active. So I think he's being watched by somebody. And I don't think it's Mirko or his new manager Sabrina. I think it's higher up. That would make sense. Yeah, it's strange that Sabrina's like transition hasn't been announced. It's just that... Unless I miss some kind of announcement. The way I found out is that she did the thing on the semi-added Bravo thing, whatever. Yeah, the campfire. Yeah, yeah, the campfire. I asked her why are we doing this. So yeah. Yeah. Like I was told it was going to take effect as of August 1st. But it's what she told me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She told me that it was afterwards. And if you go into Microsoft Teams and look at her profile, it does say manager. But yeah, it's. I would have expected some announcement, but maybe not. Maybe and maybe Mirko is off. He is. But technically it should come from calling. Okay. That's a hiring manager. Yeah. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so yeah, any other, I think any other opportunities are like that needs to be aware of or any blockers or anything like an outweigh or. Let me think. Yeah, there's the pay. Payson thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's it. There's go cardless. They are looking for an expansion, but it's not much, but it's still really talked about is a while back. It's still not done. Deliver who are so far satisfied with our answers. Didn't see anything. So this is good news. I'm almost done. Because I all in do it like when I have five, 10 minutes. The splitting out from the Excel file, the CIS file, the answers that were the absolute. I had a lot of answers the database. Because I think in reality, it's like 20, 30 questions that are new. I'm just skimming down through all of the 200 questions to go through that one by one. So that's another thing. So I'm starting the trip in October for the in Romania in Brazil. So I've chatted with. Michele the other day. It's just a fi. There is no direct flight to Brazil. So it means that we need to arrive there a day early and leave a day afterwards. We still don't know what's the best way to get there either rent a car from Bucharest, which I want to avoid or go by train. There are flights as well because there is an airport in Brazil. But you need to link them with the flights from Paris and stuff like that. It's like once a day. So if you're in the morning and then the flight is in the afternoon, not going to stay one day in the airport. Right. So we need to figure that out. We still have time. So we're going to look later on. But we already had the look. I think is it for Steve who's the marketing manager that she kind of involved too low? No, no, but if I mean I'm I'm from Romania, right? No, I know very well what what the options are and that brother this night by myself then have somebody from marketing suggest something and then in reality. Because like I for example, I never take the bus to go there. Because arriving there from Bucharest, it's like you have to cross the mountains. So it's it's a very windy road. So I'd rather not take the bus. But yeah, I think hopefully you can get some flight options which means you land and then fly to brush off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be the best the best way. Okay, yeah, no, that's fine. Obviously arrange whatever's best for you. Yeah, I guess road trip with me. Sounds appealing. There might not be that fun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, there is another airport close by like one hour away. So that might be interesting by car because it's like a straight road. No mountains or nothing. But from from Bucharest, no, it's like five hour drive and something like that. It's it's what interests folks do. They they they rent cars and they just go like that, but it's not my thing. No, I can believe you, if you like I'd rather just let someone else drive me somewhere. Yeah, okay. Yeah, let me know if you need any kind of support. Yeah, yeah, no, that should be fine. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, anything else that looking to discuss? The yeah, the thing with the remaining national ID. So I spoke enough line with Marisa and she's going to write in the thread as well. If she hasn't already. There is no workaround. So the idea that we were mentioning yesterday. I knew it wasn't, but I didn't want to be like the bad guy. So I tried to give as much detail as possible. Basically, we're not handling the gathering of the pin but we're doing everything else. So that's not possible as well because it requires a lot of development on our side. The complicated part is not adding one screen to the SDK. The complicated part is what are we doing with the code afterwards? So so there's no plan before like let's say next, next autumn. So we're going to have to have it delivered. So the only way to move forward is if regular complaims and they will complain because it's just that they haven't seen it yet, but they will. They will complain for sure 1%. Yeah, I'm still going to try and speak to you of drones. There's some why this is high priority. Ultimately, it's going to affect revenue. And yeah, Romania is going to be one of our key strategic territories. So I don't understand why I don't know. I don't see. Okay, no thanks for sharing that on the channel. I still need to read through that thread, but at least this. And yeah, and I saw that you tagged him also in Osama, so hopefully I know Rosas. Yeah, yeah, Rosas is off, I think, but Osama is in the case. Okay. I don't think there's anything else from my perspective. Yeah. On one thing on my side, I started doing the certificate for right for the command of the message. And I haven't read the first page that says clicking save doesn't save. So I've done like three quarters and then I saved it because I had a call. And then when I got back, it started from scratch. So I was so annoyed that I put it and if it for a while. So hopefully I'll have the energy by the end of the week to start it again. But yeah, the language is very confusing. I think it's done on purpose, but it's pretty straightforward besides that. Yeah, no, I haven't done it yet. Thanks for reminding me. Yeah, I mean, if I think it's your native English speaker is going to be easier, but for the people that are not native, it's very confusing. The wording is very confusing, specifically because the examples that they give are like with pharmaceutical companies, far more and all of that. So you have to put yourself in the shoes and really pay attention when you read. It's not complicated questions, but you need to really pay attention on the way they were the things and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah, no, I would be frustrated if that happened to me. Cool. Well, yeah, I don't think there's any particular timeline on getting that done, but yeah, it would be great. I mean, I want to have a display on LinkedIn, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. And if you started the language academy, was that kicked off? Yes, it is, but now it's on break because it's August, but yeah, I mean, for me, it doesn't change much because I've done almost everything. I need like two or three mandatory courses, and I need to do the quarterly check-ins with you. That's the only things that are missing. Otherwise, I could have completed the last last year, but it's the quarterly check-ins with you. I didn't want just. Is there are some folks that just filled out the quarterly manager thing by themselves. I'm not from this group, but in general, what I've seen speaking about that. I think I want to do it properly. Yeah, Michael and Danielle lead it at last year, and our quarterly check-ins were, let's say, brief. So, yeah, don't worry too much about the quarterly check-ins. You could probably, from our one-to-ones, you could probably think, okay, I've spoken to Jero about this and that. So, yeah, what I'm trying to loosely say is, like, do what you need to do. I don't know if you wanted to talk about the content. I'm actually happy to have the course of the check-ins, but yeah, I appreciate that. Okay, it's just an extra work essentially. Okay, thanks. Okay, no, no. No, it's that and the mandatory courses that you need to sign up. Those that I didn't do so, yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah, and that's nothing else for me. Sounds good. Great. Well, yeah, it's good to catch up, Michelle. Yeah, I'll see you. Same. See you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
