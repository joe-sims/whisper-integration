340g 440g 440g 440g 440g 440g 640g 640g 840g ...during that and they...the lady, why mum, is for a moistureer. I'm struggling with words today as you can see. She's from moisture so they move back there, they used to live in breast stores so they've moved back to Vienna. But they come every hour and again to stay and catch up, still a lot of boys, good friends were fed with. So yeah they they came yesterday, stayed overnight, still here this morning, she's got two boys. So yeah the household is pretty, pretty manic at the moment. Oh my god Paul Alice, that's also... Yeah, it's a great entertainment for her. She is just wide-eyed like, boys screaming each other and she's having a whale at the time. But yeah it's been a pretty busy weekend. Saturday was mainly us cleaning the house to make sure it didn't look like a bomb had just gone off. Yeah, yeah, apart from that, yeah, we had a great day yesterday. Luckily it wasn't raining so we took them to the park and they just ran off their energy. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a bit of a while, we've well-winned weekend, how about you? We were the same last week, Sir. And our neighbours, our old neighbours, Eileen and Mom is Swedish, so they moved back to Sweden. Yes. And they're, so they're saying something they'd come back over for a bit and they stayed a couple of nights and we've got a little girl, they're just Nancy and they're like super like close and stuff. So that was really nice. Like, yeah, you spent the day before just like cleaning Sir. And I'm like, oh, you haven't cleaned for us, have you? Oh no, absolutely not. But yeah, also we actually, it sounds really bad, really stupid, but we had to actually clean because we've been on the holiday and stuff. Our cleaner then went on the holiday, so we kind of like missed a few weeks. So like, I mean, like we're not dirty, even when you have a cleaning, you still kind of clean because you have kids right? You can't help a lot. That's like properly cleaned stuff, but so yeah, and another feeding and it's, don't be blissed tomorrow when no one's in the house, they'll feel almost like, empty make me like. For then the house probably a bombsite again. So yeah. We just recess, essentially, after a couple of days. Yeah. No, we were quite nice to be catch, we did. When Charlie did, so we went in the park around Saturday, when Charlie did her 25th park room whilst being 25 weeks pregnant. So yeah, she, and she was really good at it and stopped around the whole thing. So like, you know, so yeah, she was super chuffed. So I just like, I just like put along next to her, was dancing in the prime in the running prime. And then I took them in the car afterwards and I went for a run afterwards on my own. And then he, Charlie was out on like a brunch with some friends afterwards. So me and Charlie, I mean, Nancy just chill out, went in town. Then we got Charlie later on. Yeah, it was nice. And then yesterday we went very picking. So we got loads of, yeah. So we got a big lunch box full of berries from our park nearers and then came back and made an apple, well, raspberry and apple crumble, which was nice. I also bought, again, I've been looking at like games for Nancy to play on the Nintendo, which she can play because we play Mario Kart a lot. Yeah, we've got a switch. Yeah, yeah. But we play like, I get next year, it is not amazing yet, but she likes, you'll play Mario. Mario's quite good because you put on a set into the Caledrous itself. We've done the Bluey game. I was like, I'll look on Reddit and a few people mentioned a couple of games say, I got Untitled Goose game, which is quite funny. Yeah, actually loved it. Like, if I was hilarious, I think it seemed furious in playing with that. But for that, it is good because you can put that co-op way to Geese and you're just causing chaos. Oh, amazing. Yeah, me and Charlie finished it last night that went to it to bed. So that was quite good. And then I'll just put, I got Charlie to get a game off, vented, believe it or not, because a lot of people recommended KB in the forgotten land. And I've never played the KB games. Yeah, no, I think I've heard that one. I remember trying to do some research about the Kid of Brew Brew games. And that was when I came up. Another one is Yoshi. Was it Yoshi's Knitted Kingdom? Okay. That's just like a 2D platform, like Mario, but it's quite cool art style, like everything's knitted. That's quite a good one. But yeah, let me tell you how Kirby goes. Yeah, I think it's one way you can do co-op, but if you play a one, you do more than player two, so you can kind of like, shatter on the kid through it. It's just hard enough because it obviously can't read yet. So it's trying to find games where she doesn't need to read. But that was like, so it's a bite, brand new. It's still 50 quid, brand new that. Yeah, okay. The minute. Just don't decrease. And they barely gone sale. Rarely gone sale. So yeah, really brilliant. Yeah, it's like the other games, like the goose game cost me like a quid. Like the like they're all the non-intender, but make games like super cheap and stuff. But then yeah, anything that's like an intender character. But yeah, Charlie, we've got we sell loads of stuff on vintage. So Charlie's got like 200 pounding credit or something. So like, so you had to look on there and managed to get it like that equipped. I even went in CEX at the weekend. For a while, it's secondhand, isn't it? Still 45 quid secondhand is like, wow, I can't believe it. It's like, uh, so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Well, my friends have just bought the new Nintendo switch the second one. And yeah, the like I think I probably will buy at some point, but the the games, because I was looking at like, yeah, some of the games, like even like, I've kind of stood at the cost for the Switch one where like, yes, if you buy like a Mario game, it's going to be 50 quid. The other games are quite cheap. But now like, I think like Mario Kart's like 90 quid or something to buy on its own. I think it's 80. But we're just still insane. Yeah, there's a lot of drama about that. Yeah. Because yeah, I almost got the Switch to because you can buy it with Mario World and it reduces the cost of Mario. So, and they said it was an unlimited time. So I thought, oh wait, the Custco, cut costs, but then I realized I probably don't need a Switch to. Edward is absolutely fine with the Switch. Yeah. Because there's not that many games out as well. You've got Mario, I think, there's a new Donkey Kong game that looks quite cool. It's come out, but that's not much else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why I've just held off for like, you know, not really needs to do it. Or I'm also like in summer, I don't play as much because I come out doing stuff and whatever. So, um, but if Nancy starts playing it in mind, so if I could probably warrant it, she'll be in put. But yeah, we'll see. But, um, but yeah, one of my friends got one. So I'll have to see what she says. I'll see what she thinks. It's good and stuff, but, um, so yeah. So yeah, that was my, it is bigger, a bigger screen. So like, I guess it's good from that perspective. Yeah, the only thing I was a bit like me and it's a proper like, like, I don't know if, I've said this to a few people. A few people have been like, looks at me as a, I'm worrying about, um, being a bit like Piketty. But like, it's got really big bezels. I found it really annoying. So like, because during the first Switch, I had like quite big bezels and then they brought out the OLED one and that was like a lot bigger. And it's like, it's like when you look at a mobile now, you, it's such a nicer screen when there's no bezels. And the new one come out and yet it's a bigger screen. The handset's really big. But there's still quite big bezels. And I was like, I don't know, I just sort of like looked at it. And if I was same a one gripe would be like, why? Like, because if you can put that technology into the old one to keep the bezels to similar sort of size, well, you could have had an overall small one, a handset and stuff. But I know there's a lot more going into it. It might be that the battery and the chip and stuff means there has to be so big or whatever. But when you really look at it, you think you just know that with the next thing, there'll be a new Switch 2 and it'll be like smaller improved bezels to your own, e-mix sort of like, you know. The cynical part of me says that there's probably done that on purpose because in a couple years there'll be the Switch 2 OLED edition. It's, you won't have any bezels. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was by only like little gripe with it. But I still like, I do like the holding. It's funny because I was never really that big into the Nintendo scene when I was a kid. I was more like a PlayStation Xbox really, but like, I do like it. I do like kind of how it differentiates itself against kind of just the noise, which is like all the other games, to me, you know. Yeah, yeah. Nintendo just kind of do their own thing, they know. Yeah. And sometimes it works. Sometimes you get the Wii U, which, yeah, it wasn't a great success. But yeah, no, it is cool that Nintendo seems to be like more family focused and kid focused, which is nice. Whereas PlayStation Xbox, they have kid stuff, but then you've got like, fought like plastic all over everything. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I just feel like a bit. Sometimes it's like, like, I've got, I've got an Xbox because I use load of vouchers to get it. Yeah. And like, I played it a lot of first. And then like, I've not really turned it on for like probably two months. So I'm not like, I mean, sort of like, I don't know. It's one of the time to it's like, uh, yeah, there's so much like the same sort of stuff on there, like, you know, and when I had a play on that, I always think less of myself two hours later. I was playing like, what was it? What does it all mean? Yeah. I could have. I could have had a time like, it seems like such a good idea. And then, so, uh, did I replace those two hours? The tends to go by like, it's in a flash. And there's like, oh, yeah. Probably wouldn't be able to do that for another couple of months. Like, what was the point? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How's, how's we looking? Obviously we talked about the, what was it? Cool. I had no, the RWS, pretty serious assessment. Do you want to share that with me? We can take a crack at it today. So, Angus come back and said, it's okay. Like, and like, she's like, oh, well, even if it's done by Closer Business Tuesday. So, because my today is not too bad. Um, and I've only got a couple of meetings tomorrow, which aren't that bad. So, I think what I would say is without being, if this is okay with you, Joe, I'd help you, I'm happy to just kind of like, just smash it out on my own. Um, and then I'll drop you a message, Closer Business today, just to tell you like, temperature check. Oh, well, I've done. Because if I'm like 89% of the way through by today, then it doesn't need to. It's not going to impact my workload, because I've got two things tomorrow that, you know, they're not that heavy, sir. Um, but I do really appreciate you offering to help and jump in if, if needs be, but I'll, um, is that okay with you? If I just kind of let you know by and today on getting on. I was really looking forward to it then. I'm sure you were, mate. I hope you find out the office there. I know how painful these things can be. Um, but yeah, it's funny. It's, it's funny. I hope I get to like, I'm going to fill it in. I'm going to send some of it and then I'm going to tell anchor to send them an email with a very carefully crafted email from me to say, I've submitted this here, our own, um, privacy impact assessment. That you can see because you've signed an NDA. But I'm going to carry out and say all of our responses are massively carry added, because we know nothing about what you want to do. You know, and I've answered it in that way. You know, you cannot, we cannot ask, we cannot answer a specific question, because it could vary massively depending on the products you take from us. And I think that's just the risk of that. It's it because it, you know, sort of like, well, you know, if they come back and say, well, that's not, you know, it's not good enough. So what, what you want us to do, we can't talk. We don't know what to do. Like you're not talking to us like, you know, um, so it's, it's incredibly backwards way of doing. I've seen, you know, like, I've even read it and because email shared. And there's nothing in there like around requirements to even give me an indication other than there's a few things. I think they reach out to anchor. Like months ago and said, do you support any of these things? And it was all to do with watch list. And it's sort of like very unique kind of like a source, sources. An anchor has come back and said, this is what we do generally across our watch list product. And they was like, oh, yeah, well, we want to carry on talking to you. And that was when she was like, like, oh, yeah, can you do this? I've seen the assessment. And they've given us a little bullshit around why they ask people to do it. But yeah, you might do that. But again, why are you filtering out vendors via that means before you've been talking to them because you're wasting our time and you waste your own time because it's not just just filling it out. Is you reviewing it? So you're going to go give it to a team and say, right, review all Ben's answers. And then in the 10 minute conversation on the next one, we might go, oh, they want bank verification. We can't do it. It sounds like a procurement team. Like, yeah. Oh, yeah. Like, yeah, I got that tick box exercise. It must be. I know some procurement teams have all the power. Yeah. Yeah, it's really frustrating. Yeah, thankfully, like I said, it's not like in the height of like busy stuff. So I couldn't do it. But yeah, I'm just like every time I read a question thing, I'm spending too much time on this. I am spending too much time on it and just put a one word out and just move on. The little Ben and I'm usually why the way I'm doing, I'm going to do it is I've got like our identity security homepage, public first and homepage on one screen. The question around the other. And then there's a deep, you go just basically lifting generic crap off that. And then if they ask anything more than that, then I have to be a quick AI check. Is it okay? Oh, where you go. So hopefully I should fly through it. I've got no meetings after this. And I could just crack on put some music on and some I should help. Yeah. I'm sure it's the. I'm pretty sure that's what. Yeah, but otherwise I should hope that I'm hoping we'll have some signed deals this week. Cause I got some some stuff that's been going on. I like company called Web Enable software, which is the one we wouldn't. We've kind of replaced a vendor midway through their build. And they're super happy. They've been. Is Web Enable software and then they've got a tech team. And the tech team have been reached out to me directly. And they've got it up and running. The other few questions like really good questions like that sure they've done it properly, which is good. They were hoping to sign on Friday, but apparently they've come. This tech team I don't think they've delivered the full end to end thing whilst they've delivered the on feed a bit. So Zach was a wind gen I was like, don't worry, said look we don't know a bit like we can't control whether the app team have developed the rest of the app or not. That's for them to manage. But they're not far off. But when they do get there, we're we're we're built in and integrated. So they'll have to sound of us. So that's good. I'm. You the close day for that is. 30th of August. Yeah. Yeah, so that should close out. And then there's another one called first formations, which is a trial of the minute. And we had a bit of a problem last week where proof of the dress stopped working. Completely in trials. So but actually we managed it quite well with them. They did actually. No, they might they rerun the tests the following morning. And it all the right behavior came through again. So they were pretty happy with that. The only issue I've had with them is that they want to be able to customize document selections for P.O.A. Which is the one I stumbled across when I shouldn't have stumbled across it. Because it's not released yet. No, not till the end of the month. Yeah, it's available to test. Well, I don't think the I don't think the I think it was just completely by chance that they'd asked me that question during a trial. I went and looked out. I went and tested because it was one of those where I don't do a lot of work on P.O.A. So I thought I just test my own. I was like, I mean, I could do it. I could customize. And I was like, no, this is how you do it. And he was like, we can't see this. And I was like, oh, and then that's where the P.O.A. team were like, why can you see it? Like send us your trial account details. They must have been by the deployed it by accident on some accounts only. And I've told them that it's available under the month, probably soon. They're just there on the side of caution, but it's come in. And the other thing they had was about putting their own logic into the validity date. And I just said just be careful because we have our own logic in there. So if you're adding your logic on top of that, just be careful that you can add it in. You can add custom logic in, but it's it might show the report. It should just be like the passes and then they just filter it down even further. I think they just had a bit more of a stringent one. They wanted all of them to be within three months, but and a set of documents a bit longer. But yeah, we've got a trial review of them on Wednesday. And he was pretty happy even with the issue we had on Friday. And we wanted to move quite fast. We're hoping on Wednesday will be a case of we finished our testing. I think they were doing some more into when testing this time round this week, around doing the dock emotion element of it. So playing around with that, but they're pretty happy with everything else, how I do our works and proof of address. That one's probably I think Zach's main one for this quarter, because it starts off around sort of 40,000 pounds. But I think there's quite a lot of scale with that one. So yes, I heardfully those two will sign this week, which would be nice. So yeah. So another one with anchor, which is periculum. That's very good. It's closing next week. It's 56k. Periculum. It does ring a bell. I feel like is that the one that's not really periculum. Oh, here it went. Oh, to them. Was it this one? Oh, yes. Yes. That was the reason why I don't remember that is because the lead came in on Thursday and they told anchor they were to sign by the following Monday. So I spoke to them on a, I did a demo on a Friday. And it did go really well. They've got everything they need. And they were like, yeah, we're really happy. And they're expecting to get back to them Monday. So I will ask them actually on my catch of where she's got with that. But yeah, they seem like a pretty legitimate company. They were, I think they support like, there's a technology shop for businesses in developing countries basically. So it's quite a cool use case and in an interesting market. But the problem they had was they only did database checks at the minute. And their database checks with local governments in Africa. So they've kind of like, they want to move and scale. But the problem they have is understanding that they don't, that it's quite unique in Nigeria. Well, in Africa that you can do that. You can make calls to databases. I have to spend a bit of time explaining to them how in the UK and other countries you don't have that gift. That's why you've got to come to a solutions provider. And they were like, yeah, that's fine. We can just keep our process for how we do this here. But actually for countries outside of it, and we can explore. So, but there's a lot of nodding and like, yeah, you know, that sounds like the right approach and stuff. So yeah, fingers crossed that one sounds as well. Yeah, well, I just got it to close on the 10th. Yeah, I'll message it to C because they were meant to get back to on the following, they were really aggressive on wanting to move fast. But she's not mentioned it to me. So, Yeah, so I've not even worked on that one. So that was one James James put a request in, and he would like give me some prayer. You're just not, obviously not needed me. But yeah, funny because I've got this SEB bank, one SEB company thing with James tomorrow. Oh, yeah. And that's end of all, I wanted James and it's like, they're moving to motion, but the Morry told me the more, I don't know, there's any revenue associated with it because it's, yeah, yeah, babe. 19K upsell, but it's not Jews or Colors until the end of September. He doesn't think, well, the way he was saying is, it sounds like they're actually doing for some reason, selfie and video in the same workflow at the minute. So, if anything, I'm, we're going to be losing money because they're going to go from two checks to one check with motion. So that's a bit of a weird and wonderful one. But I do have it as much involved with that one either. So, that's what it is. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll, when I'll speak into James tomorrow, I'll ask him about Asia balance if there's anything else he needs. So yeah. Cool. I don't think there's anything for my side. So yeah, just, I put in the weekly deal with you, of cinema, so the team asking for volunteers. Yeah, I think, oh yeah, I'm on leave tomorrow just for a day to just charge her. Okay. Awesome. No, thanks mate. Yeah. Why are you doing tomorrow? Just look after the kids. For my eldest, a new bike. Well, such, yeah, no, it isn't a new bike because his one was very small. So we bought it from Bath. So we're going to, I'm going to surprise him tomorrow. Tomorrow morning, we're going to hop in the train to Bath, pick it up, and yeah, do some cycling together. Oh, I've been nice. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully the weather's okay mate. And you don't, you don't get blown away with the, this storm. Yeah, yeah, maybe we'll just be picking out tomorrow and maybe not doing the cycling part. But yeah, we'll try and make a day of it, like go get some food and stuff. Yeah, that sounds nice mate. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Enjoy. Yeah. And I'll, I'll speak to you when you get back. Yeah, let me know how it goes with the privacy assessment. And if it looks like it's actually going to be a lot harder than you've anticipated, let me know. Thanks mate. All right, dude, speak to you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.
