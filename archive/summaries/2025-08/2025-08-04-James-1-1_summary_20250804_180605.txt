FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 Hey James. Hey James, did you have a money right? Yeah, all right. How are you? Yeah, I'm all right. I just just I think I'll just flip two rounds. I don't know how I did that. It's really throwing me. Yeah, how's the way? How's your weekend? Yeah, busy. I had some friends stay over who are still here. They've got two boys so the house is carnage at the moment. Have you ever seen all of these fun? Yeah, yeah, it's lovely, but we spent most of Saturday just tidying the house up because it was an absolute pigstow. And then, and then, yeah, they arrived yesterday. It's yeah, pretty, pretty manic, but I'm happy to be in my little office. Pretty simple way. Yeah, we went to the day after the schools broke up, we took our three up to the Northfoot coast to this car around holiday park thing and met up with all of their cousins. So there's like nine girls all under 10 all like they're loose on the beach and the arcades and like this, you know, it's just absolutely nuts. But having them all at home all day every day is just crazy. All right, they go through a club tomorrow for the first time, which is good. We're getting out of the house, but yeah, it's lovely, like I say, but it's just it becomes such an unproductive period of time. Yeah, it's crazy. I guess it's nuts that there isn't more support, like I know from a government position, they want parents to work and yet we're expected to work out at the same time. I'll do this in a day that apparently, because 100 K impressionist, if you're over 100 K, you don't get access to any childcare, which is going to be quite true for most people in sales positions. So when this rule was enacted in 1992, 100 K was worth the equivalent of 250 K now. So that is when the threshold should ultimately sit up, but up a lot of the two-core of a million bid and such, it's way down at 100 K. And I'm like, well, you really do. On that, my top 2 now get a score. So I only got one in childcare, but still cost me £1200 a month. That's nuts. So that's two days a week. I can't believe they've ever moved the threshold. Because even like the 50 K to 60 K threshold, I'm sure that was, I can't remember what you used to get. That was just more money or something. But yeah, it's crazy that they've ever moved any of the thresholds. It's one person, so if I am 101 K for the wife of the 99 K, we wouldn't qualify. If we both got 99 K, we would qualify. And I don't know if Fancy's sacrificing my salary that much, like putting it all into pension. That I mean without being cracked, it's not possible. I literally couldn't get below it. But it's even a great problem to have, but you also feel like really I'm really punished. Taking money every single step way they turn to pisses you off. Oh well, I suppose we can't really complain too much, setting our little offices with all of our hobbies set behind us. It's just like the principle of it. Yes, like where we are very lucky to be in the position where we're in, but as the principle like you're. Yeah. I can't even try and talk to the school parents about it, but you can't be bringing up because you got the basically admit that you're earning fair bit of money. And it's looking like you're a wanger. Yeah, when someone mentions it, like, your children probably get like free, I'm like, no, but I can't say that. So I'm just like, yeah, I think people think that if you're 100 K, you must be rich, you do a massive house. It's just not true. Like, I've got fucking both of my money and everyone. For sure, I'm not sure if we. Is there a forum where we've read it called Henry, which is higher? Not retired. Yeah, I'm all over. Not rich at year. There's the area of fire. I keep trying. Yeah, fire. It's quite different. But by the way, it's the advice actually for Henry stuff. Like it's don't feel a loophole as I've found. Yeah, no, Henry's good. Yeah, there's just so many people who like, I didn't grow up with my name, but I've been in. So this is new, but don't feel rich at all. Even though it's good. So I think things like, I don't really understand things like capital gains, tax and Ices and like, yeah, all the stuff. Never did any of this. My parents never didn't know I knew what I'm talking about. They're trying to find somewhere to like put your money responsibly as well when you've got a bit to turn and scroll away. Like I had to do all that. But I say, tell me what I'm having. Yeah, it's funny. I went from, I was only like, when I first started sales at 2018, I was on 28K a year and with the 9K bonus. And they're, we celebrate quite nicely over the years. And like, it's amazing how quickly you are, commentize yourself to the new money. Like all of the, all of the advice is like, live on your initial salary and just scroll the next way. Like don't live up to that expectations. No, not to live. What's the point? My bills are multiplied. Yeah, then said my kids, that's what I blame on the kids. Yeah, no, the kids are very expensive. Yeah, when I first started work, I think I was on 23K and that was in 2011. And like, it was a very gradual progression and suddenly I got into sales, isn't it? Yeah, it was going to dump dump dump dump dump dump dump. Probably that though. I don't know people like expecting massive salary runs every year, because that's what the things that you know, you know, you got a, it's got a, it's got a sale. Like your early years, you have fun, you can jump up. But you're also one of the few percentages that get to jump up. Everyone gets to keep making those leaps. Yeah. But it's going to, I think what going that week has made it every time we're going to eat is that 150 crit. Down the pub, 150 crit. Well, I'm dipping to know those 150 crit. But Donald now is any 40 crit for the family to eat? Your kids good eaters as well. No, no. Well, I say they're not bad eaters. If you sit there and like, you're not getting down to the veggie bread and stuff, they're all sitting there. I'll eat it. Yeah. But I think they went to the front difference. My wife's friend's house on Friday. As she says up like a goat's cheese versus marto tartlet type thing, which is delicious. And their, their kids like just turned one, you've all been down all of it. And once we can set their like, uh, like, what am I? My kids don't start wretching if that, but it sounds amazing. But yeah. They, they, the past, they're quite good with, vegetables, they're pretty good with. Yeah, no, they're not the best. By the thing that's supposed to be that age, I think they'd get climbed. It's, yeah. So when they're babies, I think, well, when they're young, they're like, my experience, they were great. And then suddenly they were like, oh, actually, I'm done with experimenting. I just, I just want like what I like. But yeah, the reason why I asked that question is like, when I go out to a restaurant on the other side, there's like burgers and stuff like my kids have got good appetite. So they may not eat the best, but they were eating a lot. So, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Not too bad with that. But um, probably as they always, my, my oldies might always orders the wrong thing. Like, she always thinks she's going to be like, fancy in order something. Then it comes like, I want that, I want that. I can't. I can't tell you that. Yeah, I mean, that, I mean, the dad attacks, it's got three or five kilos in the last couple of years. Yeah. Oh, my word. It's just so easy. But yeah, my dollars is like, five small dollars, T.L., we want the donals, chicken, like happy meals, I'm sure you're like an awful parent, give it a term. But sometimes, Joe, sometimes it's just too easy. He's got to do it sometimes. So, you're not going to punch all this. Do you go away anything again? Yeah, we had our holidays. So no, I think we're just, we'll get a visit my parents for a couple of nights, I'm talking. But yeah, no, we're done. We're going to Northwood next weekend for a week. My parents, the more sister had a kid in April. And that's the only other grandchild they've got. Arthur A and that's the new grandchild they've got. So we're all going on like a, to the lodges type place in an orphan bar, I think. It's going to be lovely. I'm looking forward to not spending a week thinking about this shit here at the moment, to do it. Let's do my film. Nothing. I don't know much else. We've got a little day trips and stuff planned with the kids. But Rauwell on September, I've got multi-in September for Sigma, which is quite nice. There have been no longer. How nice. I got the Gibran go for my team for that. No, I don't really know what we're going. Like, interest is strange with this stuff. Like, they come to me and go, we need, we need you and one of your teams come to multi for Sigma if I was like, okay, but we don't really have any customers there. We've got like two or three, but other than that, like, no, no, no, we need more from you and you have to have one from you and your team. So me and Johnny are going, but literally there's like life score, there's own and who else is it? Soft about three customers that are going. I was like, you could send someone else then I know, no, no, you got to go. So I'm not going to argue. I'll go sit in my water for three days. Yeah. It's how things are. Okay, it's going as well. And it's like five people. Yeah, it goes going. Ang does going, I think, Zack's going, Laura's team, Johnny's going, I'm going, Brand's going. And there's interest isn't going as well. And it's just nuts. Well, there's not 10 people like this event. And it's going because in particular one of our biggest industries, no, no, I'm about like, I think I dropped a multi for a couple of days, but I've got to get back early because it's my little ones first day at school. That's also fun. So if you got, yeah, you've got two in school. So two in school. Yeah, well, it's probably going to year two this year. My youngest one is going into reception first class. And yeah, my youngest is going to be two, so she's still three years away. Okay. So yeah, she, well, how do you got three now? Yeah, three boys. Two boys. Two boys together. Let's get our Christians got three girls. That's not thinking. Oh, no, all these having three boys. That's what it is. Yeah, that's it. Oh, yeah. No, someone's got three boys coming up. Yeah, it's only. How's that one getting on? How old is she now? She is five months. Yeah. She's five months already. No, I can't time flies. No, she's doing great. She's a very happy little baby. She does all the baby stuff. It doesn't sleep. But yeah, she seems pretty chill, apart from the not sleeping. But yeah, my middle child is going to start things as well this September. So, okay, cool. The same age is pretty much just the end of the year. How was your oldest one? He started year three. So a year older, I guess, than yours. One is a year older and one is the same age. Yeah, okay, cool. I do. So just when they go into, what was this key stage two, isn't it, year three? Is this the same school? Was you going to move to a different school? No, it's, yeah, I know some schools do that, but no, it's the same school. So we like, yeah, some have like a, what's it? I can't remember the junior school and an infant school? We've got an infant in the juniors. So I was a split through Swires. Is it still, is it actually separate locations or? Yeah, it's only the village. So it's not like it. So we've got one that's we're right in the middle. So one's there and then one is just up the road there. But our kids are split in such a way that at one point we'll have one of the village college, which is the age of the village. One of them up the juniors and one of the infants. The school time is going to be in nuts, like green locations. It is walking distance, but it'll probably be cycling distance is the reality. I don't think we have much of a choice. It's not really that drive-blyard because it's all the one way system throughout the village. So there's no quicker to get the car because you're not going all the way around several times over. But you're looking at the middle one looking for the school. Is you ready? Yeah, I think he's ready because he comes on the school run, like walks with us in the morning. So he's seen his older brother. I think it's just a five day thing. He's not in preschool or five days a week. He's in only two days and we have my indoors looking after him one day and then my wife works part-time. So jumping up from two days to five days I think will be the toughest transition for him. When does he turn five? Is he like start reading and thinking? Oh, okay, so he's always the right side then. Yeah. We've had the middle one's been in three days a week at nursery for a couple of years now. And I think she's desperate. Like she cannot wait to go. But she's not five very much. But I think she watches all the sister. He's only a little bit older than her. They've been in the same school for a bit. I think she's just going through the same class that she was in. So I think she's buzzing. But it's first month and they start school always nuts there. They become right dickheads. If you got like a weird transition period as well where like are going half a day for like two weeks. It's not that long. Day one is like come and meet the teacher and then day two is come for breakfast. Day three is come for the path of the morning. So just get him in. Like it's not problem. I got time with this. But yeah, it is the same. It's not apparently in a way it was different because it started a year earlier. Not really. Yeah, not only we're saying that the nursery kind of becomes school a year earlier. And it sounds better to me. But I'm just looking forward to the three, five day week child care. Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, how things. Things you sounded like frustrated. It's just pain in the ass. Every right turn is pain in the ass. Yeah, we moved to revenue obviously. We still haven't got an actual way of forecasting revenue. I'm selling the pressure for bookings. Bookings takes away from revenue. The team on pushing bookings. Colour was forecast a different way to the rest of the regions. It's going to have some, I don't even call it delusion necessarily. But he wants my best case number to like four, five million dollars worth of pipeline. I was like, this code, I couldn't, it doesn't exist. It will never exist in this territory unless we increase the size of the territory considerably. And then I hope I like the cleanest off because of targets and what was miles off targets. And then yeah, I think the biggest set of it we get at the moment is every time we come to renewal, we've got a ridiculously competitive offer that we're going up against. They want to reduce commitments, reduce unit costs. And yeah, I'm going to talk to you to, I've been actually positioning flash with a few customers recently because I wasn't aware of the nuances that existed between flash and boost. I thought it was just automated boost. But then the other tells me that's not the case. The model is built differently. It's a completely different product. But I have just found out that Daniel Lopez and team are working on a fully auto product that I hope you can go live with by the end of the year. I mean, this is where it's going to get difficult because we need that to go to market with otherwise we can lose markets very quickly. So many customers want a fully automated option. And I'm happy to take the hit performance wise. Yeah. But we have a lot to offer it. I'm releasing to the posterio to Jumio. Sam, all these guys have got an offering. So I'm talking to Daniel on Wednesday about that and Daniel is put time really this afternoon to talk about it. But then the question there is that what happens to our revenue, we might be making more money because it's automated. Emerging is better than profit is there. But the revenue will look like it's down. So then what do we do? Because I could capture more traffic from customer A and make it spend less money with us over the course of 12 months, but we could make more of them. So I need to talk to anyone who understands more about that and how that's going to look like because highly people don't want to buy good to sell. We thought he thought it was Nick so that he got a link we used to go bookings, revenue, margin profit, those are the four kind of layers they care about. They've taken bookings away now. So we're the only ones that are looking at bookings. The rest of the business isn't, it's just a growth team and obviously it's revenue margins profits. Well I don't want to be the sales team that keep moving the gold price that we wanted to move from bookings to revenue. And we've got that. And I don't want to move revenue to margins or profit necessarily because we're in too much of detail. But the business does need to square away its revenue expectations to align with what it's making. But yeah, Hollywood is a little bit of faith in like everything Andrea tells me. It's just isn't happening. If I don't happen fast enough or he makes promises and disappears. So yeah, a little bit jaded at the moment but it's August now. So nothing's going to happen is it this face here. No, it's really the booking sites we're insane. I then understand how they could just follow up. And then say the bookings are important in revenue and then give us those completely unshaped energy for booking targets to stay at it. I understood the theory behind it. To basically took the gap between the expected renewal rate and the revenue and that was the bookings number. So in order to get revenue number we need to we put the bookings in order like a safeguard. But then culturally we haven't shifted away from the pressure of bookings for the forecasted bookings. And then you ask you aren't you want this territory to go over 15% this year. But unicorns are coming down all over the place. People are putting more resiliency providers in because integrations are becoming more widespread and easier to manage. We've got more competitors than ever who are offering more than we have. But we haven't really talked about having this ortho-product as a new product. It is a new product fine. But we've conceptually been able to offer step authentication for several years now. And the market is there, it's not exactly biting and like being itself to try and make it happen. We haven't got anything else to really sell. Like ID record is fallen apart in most countries. So I remember that 15% growth comes from outside of hoping other companies grow. The reason I'm strategy there, that's just hope. I think everyone is aware of this. This is what I understand. But what I don't want them to think. Because we are willing business. We're still, we're absolutely customers still, we're still performing alright. We hear our revenue number last quarter. We have 50% of our bookings number. We'll probably do roughly the same again this quarter. But is that just that look is that success to the business? So they're going to start getting panicky and start thinking about what they need to change. I don't know. Yeah, like the rest of us has even looked at our bookings or is it just I know we've got those bookings. But surely they're just revenue. I don't think they do. I'm telling you it's reported on. I think so it's pretty much only Andrea. Yeah. When feeding that up into Patrick. But because we haven't got visibility over what we're forecasting from a revenue perspective, I cannot forecast my revenue in Salesforce. Only a account forecast is revenue is is booking sorry. Which means I think the senior issue I get a bit twitchy. Because I don't know where is the revenue coming from. Where is the money coming from? We can't see it. So we were asked to put loads of opportunities in for all of the accounts that were on track to overperform against their bookings number. So those of like revenue opportunities in my Salesforce at the moment. We've also been told that we can we can get bookings quote to relief on predicted revenue growth. So if we say we're waste streamer going to spend 100 came all this year and then they're booking. We're not going to excel them but it's better for the business to keep on the unit costs and they don't want to do another deal. We're told we would get that relief. And it's not come. We keep asking for it and they're not doing it. So yeah, my de life seems like it's a funny period of time. Yeah, I must be that bookings will go away next year. Like surely. I think Pauline Watson will go away and H2 he hates them. I think he sees it as completely counterproductive to have someone try and to book and reduce unit costs and therefore reduce revenue in the same account. There should be other ways of incentivizing them. Like having the dynamic price and as you move through it or I think my friend discounts they direct some amount. It's not some of that some ideas but the business just isn't really operational. I believe it. Not very good at doing things in the year either. Now I think the thing is I mean I hate being the manager. I feel like I'm in a little time at the moment but then we we started to trade it and we we did this as a sales management team last October. We mapped out a revenue model that we thought would work and how we could do it which is now what we're operating on. But it took them seven months. No, nine months to get a compliment together for a decision we made last October. Right, we like absolutely baffled. Like the last couple of weeks of March we were running around trying to like baseline and I thought like why we didn't sell now because it's been this packing like December. How's the SE world though? Is it all coming together for you guys? Is the ticket system stuff working? Yeah, like I have that like natural resistance like because I don't want to put more barriers between us and A's working together. I know it's been frustrating for like I know Johnny is frustrating others. I think your kind of caught in the cross hairs between us and CSM is trying to make sure we're working on what we should be working on. And unfortunately that's probably impacted you and your team. Like it's getting there and I think it will improve things and hopefully CSL lead to position where CSM's have to do more and have better account management. But yeah, it's getting there but yeah, even for us like even for my team like I think they're used to working like being able to support accounts and some like that some less so but yeah, we're getting there. Yeah, I think the thing we're adapting to a bit better now. I think you read the bandaid off and yeah, it was scary because they feel like they're left in a bit of a way. Yeah, hold on. Hold on. I don't know. We get some of the CSM's we've had recently a good I think there's many decisions around people are in the Christians and taking up a couple of accounts they're doing some things that we're we expect them to do. But I will use in Luke O'Reilly I'm using a product as well. Yeah. Okay, but our down medal was really great job the other day with Credus and like holding the four technically and like you see you really trying to apply and stuff about. So I think we are bridging that gap. Yeah, this case. But I think the plastered be ripped off quite so quickly. No, yeah, it did come suddenly. Yeah, like perhaps that transition should be the best way the other things communicate that well. It's here is it. It's facing. We're getting there. But now, otherwise, teams teams to be doing all right. Yeah. Didn't you write these fly risks when you hit them? I do. We're also going into the promotion round period. So as a couple of my guys who got hope in. So if that doesn't pan out then, yeah, I think they could be quite jaded. I was quite void. I spoke to Emma. I'll sometimes promote Johnny to senior this year because I was in Missed Outlast. I was highlighting the differences between his salary and where the likes of James and James and all the economy sitting were bringing in an empire in September that's going to be how earning him a lower, she's coming in AE, she's going to be early like eight or nine came more than he is. But she was really like, no, no, no, this is kind of thing. You make quite keen to get people as if a salary bracket. They need to be sat in particular promotion. So I'm quite void by that. But let's see if they deliver on what they promised. To be honest, I think they are quite good at that. They stick to the salary balance. Like, so yeah, if Johnny gets promoted, I'm sure he's not going to, like they tend to obviously just less than middle because they need to be room to growth. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, they are quite good at that. Okay, I've done an interest promotion. I don't feel like I should. But it's a 4K pay rise promotion. No, that is what it should be. Yeah, I did it last year for Mario. And I think it was a reason for like, yeah, I knew the pay, I knew what roles she's going into should be. Like, I don't know, I don't know how I remember being quite involved a bit last year, like having kind of almost a budget and spreading that around the scene. But I don't know whether I assume you'll be the same this year. I think so. I think we get, I've been looking through the merit and promotion stuff in the salary reviews. I think we get like a budget and I'm not really going to locate out based on their performances. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. When does your new starter join? First September. That's pointless. You've got a little work to do on her asking stuff, I think. But I think she'd be quite good. She comes from Redgate, so guaranteed credibility in her credentials at night. But I think like she really impressed me to be processed. It's nice to bring a girl in and a little bit of change in the dynamic. I think she'll shake the team up, because I think she'll come in and she will like get her head down and scrap on. It's quite nice because they've all been AFT for years now. They've all been in part of the transition and a few from her a bit pissed off or wanted to get back to her was. Yeah, we should say, we are looking forward to having her on board. I mean, I didn't like give her an SC buddy because obviously like if she was, if it in the old way she would have an SC, but obviously now she doesn't. But I think for her ramping up period, I'm happy to like assign her body that she could ask questions to. I will definitely take you up on that. I think, yeah, let me know who that can be. I think you'll definitely need that. I don't know what on board, it looks like an interest. I'll begin on a hide into interest before I will feel very much left to us to do when the last couple of years anyway. I think you'll pick it up quickly. I really do. But yeah, let me know. Yeah, first of every kind of sign, someone will be grateful and we can introduce him in the first week. Yeah, so let me know. Nice man. Cool. Oh, I'm good to go. Cool. I'm going to be a J8, you two me. Enjoy the rest of your day. And I'll ask you this soon. Yeah. Bye.
