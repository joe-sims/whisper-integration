FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 I'm sure. How are you? Good. Thank you. How are you doing? Good. Good. Thanks. How's your week going? It's going good. It's going good, be easier than expected, but it's good. It's busy in a good way. Many opportunities you've related or other stuff? Yeah, for ADQ, we owe bank the bio to bio. They're actually the first ones to move forward with a trial. So this is good. There's no reason for it not to work because it's not like it's a totally new product. But yeah, it's good. Yeah. Which customer did you say that was? It's ADQ. So the customer is we owe bank. Abu Dhabi, but it's everybody's registered as ADQ financial because that's their company name. Yes, that sounds. We owe bank it's the commercial name. So very busy with that with Raluca. It's because since it's the first one, everybody gets wants to be part of it so that their name is on Thursday. So it gets very busy with a lot of stuff and yeah, they're going to start the trial. We still don't know if there is a special amendment required for bio to bio because then trust sometimes says yes, sometimes says no. To Prem, they said no, it's not needed to Raluca said yes, it's needed. Yeah. Yeah, that would be amazing. But yeah, it's moving forward. It's moving forward. We had the trial call this morning. They have access now. So. Yeah, they're moving forward. So this is good. No, we really interesting see how that truck is especially within the first one. Are they doing yeah, device or infrastructure? I'm pushing them towards server side. They tend to agree. So we'll see. The reason I'm pushing pushing to server side is because I strongly believe that it's more stable and it avoids complications like. It's right like if it's not on the device. So if you enroll it and it's all on device, we have no way of knowing why. Right. So I want to avoid those type of discussions until at least we have some sort of logging we have something put in place. So yeah, I'm pushing towards that. And I genuinely think it's safer that way. So yeah, because even if you look. Like for example, if you're doing the web SDK, it gets stored in a session cookie within. We didn't come or whatever. So you can technically hijack that cookie. I just want to avoid all of those type of discussions. So even if you hijack it, you still need to do the authentication. So your face needs still needs to match that token. But the fact that anybody can hijack that token. It's yeah, I just want to avoid that. Yeah, no, I think for now for now for the first thing, especially since we always listening to us there like because it's new for them as well. So yeah. Interesting. So yeah, the trial kicked off today is looking to start next week. They they want to start this week. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we still don't know what's the rush. My guess is that they're in your list coming up and they want to include this in the ring. Also that they get cheaper prices. They want, but that's that's my guess. Yeah, because the renewal is like for 26k upsell. So it's not going to change much. So yeah. So that's that's my guess. Nice. Yeah, you've got a lot of opportunities. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Europe car. It's coming back again. So the frame is also mentioned that blah blah. Are releasing RFP. Yeah, is that just a standard to make sure we're still the right choice or is it just like are they looking to replace us or. I think it's same as Europe car like blah blah car. They've been with us like for eight or nine years. It's it's a lot right so it's a lot they're happy with us. Except for Brazil were very bad. So I. To be honest, there's a risk that they might find somebody else for Brazil. But I don't think that for the rest of the business, I don't think we we should worry. I just want to see what's going on in the market. Is that okay for a sign is that because he's prim. Yeah, yeah, no, it's not. I think the deadline's not till second week of September. So it's. Yeah, and it hasn't even been issued yet. No, it hasn't been issued and it's. I don't think it's going to get issued any time soon because they're all on holiday, but yeah, we'll see. It's going to be fine other way, right? I'm usually proactive from prim. Usually I would typically expect the RFP to have already been issued like a couple of weeks ago and deadlines tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, it's very I think. I think somebody is looking at what he's doing. That's my feeling because he's very, very active with we we owe bank like he's on holiday and he's checking slack. He's checking WhatsApp. So he's weirdly active. So I think he's being watched by somebody and I don't think it's Miracle or his new manager Sabrina. I think it's higher up. That would make sense. Yeah, it's strange that Sabrina's like transition hasn't been announced. It's just that. I'm less I miss some kind of announcement, but. The way I found out is that she did the thing on the semi at the Bravo thing, whatever campfire. Yeah, yeah, the campfire. That's how it is. I asked the why are we doing this. Yeah. I was told it was going to take effect as of August the first. It's what she told me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And if you go into the Microsoft teams and look at her profile, it does say manager. But yeah, it's. I would have expected some announcement, but maybe not. Maybe maybe Miracle is off. He is, but technically it should come from calling. Because that that's our hiring manager. Oh, yeah. We'll see how that goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so yeah, any other, I think any other opportunities are like that needs to be where or where any blockers or anything like an outweigh or. Yeah, let me think. Yeah, there's the pay. Pay. Payson thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's it. There's go cardless. They are looking for an expansion, but it's not much, but it's still we already talked about it's a while back. It's still not done. Deliver who are so far satisfied with our answers. You didn't see anything. So this is good news. I'm almost done. Because I only do it like when I have five, 10 minutes. The splitting out from the Excel file, the season file, the answers that were the absolute. I had a lot of answers the database. I think in reality, it's like 20, 30 questions that are new. I'm just skimming down through all of the 200 questions to go through that one by one. So that's another thing. Regarding the trip in October for the in Romania in brush. So I've chatted with. I'm going to do the other day. It's just a fi. There is no direct flight to brush. So it means that we need to arrive there a day early and leave a day afterwards. We still don't know what's the best way to get there either rent a car from Bucharest, which I want to avoid or go by train. There are flights as well because there is an airport in Brussels. But you need to link them with the flights from Paris and stuff like that because. It's like once a day. So if you're in the morning and then the flight is in the afternoon, not going to stay one day in the airport. Right. So we need to figure that out. We still have time. So we're going to look later on. But we already had the look. So the first thing is the marketing manager that she kind of involved too low. No, no, but if I mean I'm I'm from Romania, right? So I know very well what what the options are and that brother decided by myself and have somebody from marketing suggest something and then in reality. Like I for example, I never take the bus to go there because arriving there from Bucharest, it's like you have to cross the mountains. So it's it's a very windy road. So I'd rather not take the bus. No, yeah. No, I think hopefully you can get some flight options, which means you land and then fly to brush off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that that would be the best the best way. Okay. Yeah, no, that's fine. Obviously arrange whatever's best for you. Yeah, I guess road trip with Mikko sounds appealing. That might not be that fun. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, there is another airport close by like one hour away. So that might be interesting by car because it's like a straight road. No mountains, nothing. But from from Bucharest, no, it's like five hour drive and something like that. It's it's what interest folks do. They they they they rent cars and they just go like that, but it's not my thing. No, I completely agree with you. Like I rather just let someone else drive me somewhere. Yeah, okay. Yeah, let me know if you need any kind of support. Yeah, yeah, no, that should be fine. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, anything else that looking to discuss the yeah, the thing with the the Romanian national ID. So I spoke enough line with Marisa and she's gonna write in the thread as well. If she hasn't already, there is no workaround. So the idea that we were mentioning yesterday. I knew it wasn't, but I didn't want to be like the bad guy. So I tried to give as much detail as possible. Basically, we're not handling the gathering of the pinbath or doing everything else. So that's not possible as well because it requires a lot of development on our side. The complicated part is not adding one screen to the SDK. The complicated part is what are we doing with the code afterwards. So so there's no plan before like, let's say next next autumn. Yeah, to have it delivered. So the only way to move forward is if regular complaints and they will complain because it's just that they haven't seen it yet, but they will they will complain for sure 1%. Yeah, I'm still going to try and speak to you of drones. Yeah, that's been to Michael out there as well. Like from the Sun, why this is the high priority. Ultimately, it's going to affect revenue. And yeah, Romania is going to be one of our key strategic territories. So I don't understand why I don't know. I don't know if I should see. But yeah, okay, no thanks for sharing that on the channel. I still need to read through that thread, but at least this. And yeah, and I saw the interactive Ross and Osama, so hopefully I know Ross. Yeah, Ross is off, I think, but or some ones. Okay. I don't think there's anything else from my perspective. Yeah. On one thing on my side, I started doing the certificate for right for the command of the message. And I haven't read the first page that says clicking save doesn't save. So I've done like three quarters and then I saved it because I had a call. And then when I got back, started from scratch. So I was so annoyed that I put it and if it for a while. So hopefully I'll have the energy by the end of the week to start it again. But yeah, the language is very confusing. I think it's done on purpose, but it's pretty straightforward. Besides that, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think it's your native English speaker is going to be easier, but for the people that are not native. It's very confusing. The wording is very confusing, specifically because the examples that they give are like with pharmaceutical companies, far more and out of that. So you have to put yourself in the shoes and really pay attention when you read because it's not complicated questions, but you need to really pay attention on the way they were the things and stuff like that. Yeah, no, I would be frustrated if that happened to me. Cool. Well, yeah, I don't think there's any particular timeline on getting that done, but yeah, it would be great. I mean, I want to have a display on LinkedIn, right? Yeah, exactly. Join the people. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And if you started the leadership academy, was that kicked off? Yes, it is, but now it's on break because it's August, but yeah, I mean, for me, it doesn't change much because I've done almost everything. I need like two or three mandatory courses, and I need to do the quarterly check-ins with you. That's the only things that are missing. Otherwise, I could have completed last year, but it's the quarterly check-ins with you. I didn't want just. There are some folks that just filled out the quarterly management things by themselves. I'm not from this group, but in general, what I've seen speaking about that. And if I do, I want to do it properly. Yeah, like Michael and Danieli did it last year, and our quarterly check-ins were, let's say, brief. So, yeah, don't worry too much about the quarterly check-ins. Yeah. You could probably, from our one to ones, you could probably think, okay, I've spoken to Joe about this and that. So, yeah, what I'm trying to loosely say is, like, do what you need to do. Yeah. I'm here if you want to talk about the content. Like, I'm actually happy to have the quarterly check-ins, but, yeah, I appreciate that. Okay, it's just an extra work essentially. Okay, thanks. Okay, no, no. No, it's that and the mandatory courses that you need to sign up. Those that I didn't do so, yeah. Okay. Cool. All right. Yeah, nothing else for me. So, yeah. Sounds good. Great. Well, yeah, it's good to catch up, Michelle. Same. All right. See you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
