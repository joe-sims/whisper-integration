FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 I'm going to go. Another thing with me, another new opportunity coming in. Wow. For some reason, everybody on the customer prospect side seems to have been working up during the summer time as well. Yeah, yeah. More do over. Another prospect from over there. Probably helped us quite a lot that we. One, uh, trigger bank. So basically first customer from all over. We'll see. We'll see. Yeah, like. Have we done any like kind of marketing or. I know it's fairly. I don't even know how to respond to this. Surely, surely we should. I would think so. But I wouldn't necessarily say that marketing is one of our strengths that we're going to be able to do. Yeah, it depends whether we actually use for like, is that. I don't know how to. Marks into more over as like, is that the best way to get. Get like pipe or is it actually just target list and contacting. I mean, more than we're so small. We're just winning one or two customers is. Big marketing initiative in itself. Yeah. So yeah, now I wouldn't worry too much about that. But on the other hand, what I would worry about is what. Right up in our cold privacy because that one is really. Really concerning. Yeah, he just shared the. The customer requests having a chance to read all. I'm going to go through the quite long thread. But I saw the intact Ross and Osama in there, which. Good. Yeah, I just don't feel like it's got the right visibility at the moment. Rapidly not how well. Yeah, probably not the right one now. But on the other hand, it will like Andrea and the sales leader. Stay now. Yeah, I'm going to go through the list. So. Anca and me kill both. Flak this. Several times as well within the sales all. And. The way me kill is he is usually quite quick to open up. Conversations with everybody. Yeah, and we have. I mean, from developers, products. Andrea, everybody in the miracle. James. So they all know. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be surprised if we don't try and push it. Given the potential impact. Yeah. I mean, I do understand product because Marissa said. With project project. For John and everything, there is. So much going on that they just don't have the resources. And. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Kind of makes sense. But not doing anything right now is basically is. Almost guaranteed for us to lose all of our customers in Romania. Which would be pretty bad because in central and Eastern Europe, Romania is. I would say the strongest country that we have. Yeah. Yeah, it should be prioritized. We've done so much work to get compliant there. It would be such a waste to that loser. Yeah, and coming back from this. The tough one, especially considering that. We're kind of facing a lot of challenges in Romania. Anyways, remember the whole fiasco we have with the Romanian National Bank. And the writings that. The emails, the letters that went out saying don't use on feed or. And then there are those local vendors supposedly local vendors that bad mouth us in. Every opportunity they get. And this is really what we've been hearing quite a number of times. That yeah, your competitors. Pretty much saying while you don't catch any fraud, not compliant and all that sort of thing that makes it. And necessarily difficult for us anyway. And all this. Not good because. First thing about this is kind of. The competitors that bad mouth us. Then suddenly be right. At least to some extent. So all of that. Very, very unfortunate. I mean, it's not just coming up now. Not just let this. I think two years ago. You started talking about this two years ago. And no one has paid attention. Now we're here. Yeah. No, this was short. I think like. I know, I just said that the remaining government are particularly good at providing documentation. But we could have at least prepared ourselves better. But yeah, we. On field of interest that we're just not very good at anticipating change. We always react. We're not proactive. We're very reactive. And it's hard because you need to like place your bets where you think it's going to have the biggest impact. But it seems we don't place like that very well. Yeah, it just looks like. Coming back to the government. Not providing a tech documentation. The thing is it. In. I would say it is fine when talking to a prospect or customer saying, look. We're all set. We're waiting to start. We're eager to get this going. But the government hasn't provided us with the necessary documentation. That is fine. But we know this would be a lie. The problem is that. When the documentation comes out. There's still no one here wants to put in the work that that is the big problem. Because we can't just say, well, yeah, as soon as the documentation is here then. Working on this full speed. No, we're not. And that is that is the issue. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, I saw my radar more and I will speak to. Rather than people to try to get. Try to get their thoughts. Yeah, I'm interested like if all those senior growth members. I think they are aware of this. But I don't have the same level of emergency. I wouldn't know why. Yeah. So I need to have those discussions. I guess I mean apart from revolute. The only two people directly affected. Our uncle and me. And now I'm having a new territory that just leaves me. Me. I'm looking at the number. I'm looking at the number. Maybe a signal to the company. Yeah, I can't, it can't be that bad. Look at him. He's achieving his quota. To be fine. But revenue is what drives us. And if. If we don't adopt this, then we will lose revenue. 100%. Thank. Bookings. Like, I don't know. This may be the last year that we actually focus on bookings. And we're going to be able to do a new business. But how we track new business will be different. It won't be. But like committed. ACV will be usage and projected revenue. So yeah. Yeah. I'm really interested to see. I'll speak to like. Andrea and others. To get that view on this. I hope that's a bomb with the case. But if the answer is really a. No, to us putting in the work. And it got. Or it gets deprioritized or. Pushed to relate. Next year. What is. Our official communication to prospects. Yeah, supposed to be so what. I mean. I can always make something up. Like yeah, there's insufficient documents. Like yeah, there's insufficient documentation from the government that works now. Yeah. But then. What would them? Because I mean. Yeah. We need a clear communication path on how to approach this because this would probably follow us. Pretty much for every call that we have for every event that we go to and so on and so forth. Yeah, no exactly. And this is going to be our. Our stance and not need to be communicated and yeah, we need to. Disappear the consequences of that. Yep. I've learned that. How are things? Apart from that major issue, everything is going quite well. Yes. No, it's great. The chaos bringing in business. I think that I was looking at the kind of pipeline. Some up looks like it should be closing in. And that's a couple of days according to Danny and Salesforce. And that's like a 2008 upsell, which is good. Yeah, yeah, should be. I think it's just finalizing everything with them on a commercial commercial side. So yeah, that should close. Apart from that, there's just a few few small opportunities that are kind of closing towards the end of August. And then some later in September, but some up to you. It's the one that's the major one that's closing soon. Yeah, for say future closing opportunities. We are working on a couple that could potentially quite big, but it's too early to tell. I mean, the volumes. Just the numbers, they look very promising, but. I think it's too early on to make any commitments whatsoever. So we'll see, but there is there is a lot going on. So it's quite cold group armor. Income bank. Yeah, there are a couple of things that may not yet be in the right opportunity stages, but. Yeah, that is a different discussion. That I'm having constantly. Is that Mikhail or is that STRs? It is a mix of both. So. Last week, Camisa, she didn't want to open the opportunity for. Her own STR reasons, because it obviously they're tracked on a monthly basis. And it makes a difference when they create the opportunity. So it was like, yeah. Sure. So some of that. Because Mikhail is working a lot of things at the same time right now. So a couple of things get pushed back. But. To be honest, I don't mind that much in those cases, because I know. Both of them will do it this eventually. And so I'm not too worried about this. It's not like. I'm not sure if it's going to be a good one. I'm not sure. Some things will close without an opportunity. Not that it's possible anyways, but. So it's it's going to be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not. Yeah, I'm not saying a certain about that. Cool. No, it sounds good from opportunity perspective. Any of the things going on. Should be where. Just wondering because you said a couple of things that should close in in August. That would be. No, it's like in there. Yeah. So a couple of things might pop up out of the blue. This is what I'm looking at which shit like this is what's closing this quarter. This is ordered by close. Yeah. I mean, to be here. We just said the call today and they also told us the timeline. Just today. But they said yeah, life September. Okay. So, but we don't know the exact volumes yet. So. Might be might be a small deal. Yeah, it's not even. Signed to me. So, Laura, whatever reason. Yeah. Well. I would that not wait. Was that number for that? Anyway, probably smaller volumes, but still. Would be a new could. Potentially be a new customer. Cool. No, really interesting use case. And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It could open up a whole whole new. New case for us. I'd be really interested to see whether we do see the. We kind of have that use case already because they. We do have robot ticket as a customer and they are. People doing the same and robot ticket that football club. They. They work together. Sure. The robot ticket is is there. How did you call it? Ticket in partners. Okay. And they were already familiar with the integration robot ticket has. But they won. Well, they want something different. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I was just looking at robot ticket. Quite a small customer. Yeah, looks like Machouse being speak into them recently. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And I mean a couple of things going on the forecast. Well, flink unfortunately got pushed to later. And they can go on and. They can go on, you know, And they can go on and. And they can go on and. And they can go on and. This year. They want to focus on. Renewal commercials for now, but not new use cases. It has been postponed. And it was a new call with. Bych night that I is the name. So in German. Don't ask me. So basically, this probably shouldn't be with vodka now that I think of it because it would be a new customer, but ignoring that for a second because that's a business. Yeah, there is another opportunity might come in soon enough. So, what's it? Nice. Cool. Yeah, outside of opportunity work, I kind of think needs to discuss. I don't know. Nothing I can think of. I mean, it's somewhat unrelated. No, I heard from Ben that entrance office like, what is it? What would you call it? Bike leasing, bike rental cycle to work. Yeah. I wrote an email to it asking whether we had something like that available for Germany as well. I've not received an answer over the last couple of well one week now. So quite curious to see whether we have that for Germany as well. I doubt it, but I thought I'd ask anyway. So that would be kind of interesting. It's a good scheme. It's on my radar to get a new bike. It's quite a large national scheme in the UK and employees can decide whether they offer or not. We have that too. So, yeah, so if Germany has it, there's no reason why. I think it's an interesting offer. Maybe just a one. Yeah, just lazy. Because yeah, like, apart from getting a new bike, there's like this tax implications where you can like reduce your taxable amount. I think Ben is going for like a ridiculous like top of the end. Yeah. That's pretty pretty cool. I see I actually sent them an email to what was it? H.R. Communications or something. So pretty much the same address. We've been actually sent us requests to but. Yeah, it should just be an ask age. Did you send to that or. Not just just to H.R. Communications because that there was also the same the venues, but I can afford it to ask a jar as well. Yeah, try both. Double your chances. Also funny enough, interest sent me the command of the message. Participation guide again, wire so actual mail. A day or two later I received a letter from the customs that asked me to pay like 10 euros or something for for customs. Did you request. I'm not that I'm aware of. So click somewhere on yeah send it to me. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I've got the participation guide in. So just in case you're wondering when I actually upload a customs letter to to expensive by that is the reason. I very rarely check any expenses. Thanks for that. So in case somehow gets queried but yeah, don't worry. Yeah, I think when the virtual command and message sessions ended that an email got sent round saying. Like to request your physical copy like fill in this form. So maybe you just. We're not a pilot and just thought yeah. Yeah, but kind of I don't know that. Doubles my command of the messages efforts. Yeah, at least you got like you can take one on client visits now and leave on a home and. Now the only thing left is to have clients. Or maybe just hold days then. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, but yeah, I still I still wonder. How did they actually send this that I have to pay customs for a normal mail for normal letter. And I think it's paper. It's not like a proper product anyways. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I'm not even going to try and work that out, but. It's odd. Cool. Yeah, I don't think there was much from my perspective of the more we discussed in the team meeting. We've got a personal development on Friday. I can't remember why we got to in terms of goals. I think we're in a read. I think did you already upload yours into work day or were they still kind of in draft form that like the. I think the last before the last time you spoke I submitted those by accident where it was still blank. So I'm quite sure if you managed to send them back to me. Okay, we haven't we haven't really agreed on precise numbers yet. Okay, so that is that is so last time we kind of talked about high level. So for example, event attendance and things like that, but not necessarily about the numbers. Yes, that's. Go through that. We should still be. Yeah, yeah, that's what we'll review that and yeah, just agree between us. Yeah, I don't think there's anything else for me. And I'll see you later. No, good for my side. Cool. All right, then I'll leave you to it. Which is my goal. I just have to go to. Right. Bye.
