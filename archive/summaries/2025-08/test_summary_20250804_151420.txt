SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------

I apologize, but this transcript appears to be a fragment of an informal conversation about video games and doesn't seem to be a formal meeting transcript. There isn't enough context or structure to provide a meaningful meeting summary with the requested categories.

The only clear points from this brief exchange are:
- Someone discussing having to move on to review something else after spending significant time on something (presumably a game)
- A comment about games having additional content (blueprints, "room 46") beyond the main completion/credits

Without more context or a complete meeting transcript, I cannot provide a proper summary with key topics, decisions, action items, or next steps.

I think I had to move on to review something else, but I put a shitload of time into it. That's been a thing lately, these games were like, they're really good and you can see credits, but if you're real sicko, like, blue prints, you know, you can get the room 46 and everything.
