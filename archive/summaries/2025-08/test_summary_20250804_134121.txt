FULL TRANSCRIPT  
--------------------------------------------------

 No, because I think I had to move on to review something else, but I put a shitload of time into it. That's a thing lately. These games were, it's like, they're really good and you can see credits, but if you're a real sicko, like like Blueprints, you know, you can get to room 46 and everything.
